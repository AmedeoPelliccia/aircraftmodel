## Inheritance Boundary Change Requests (IBCRs)

<<<<<<< HEAD
IBCRs reclassify content between SHARED and FORKED inheritance boundaries.
Each IBCR must specify:

- **Source boundary** (SHARED or FORKED)
- **Target boundary** (SHARED or FORKED)
- **Affected ATA chapter(s)**
- **Justification**
- **Impact assessment** on sibling programme (BWB ↔ WTW)

=======
Per AMPEL360-FAM-IBD-001 Rev B §8.4, any proposal to reclassify a SHARED
entry as FORKED (or vice versa) in the Inheritance Boundary Declaration
requires an IBCR reviewed by both programme Chief Engineers and approved
by the AMPEL360 Family Programme Manager.

IBCRs are logged in this directory.
