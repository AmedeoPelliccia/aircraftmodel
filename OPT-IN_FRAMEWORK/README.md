# OPT-IN Framework

The OPT-IN Framework provides a 5-axis topology for organizing aircraft design and development:

## 5-Axis Topology

- **O-ORGANIZATIONS**: Organizational structures and entities
- **P-PROGRAMS**: Program-level documentation and management
- **T-TECHNOLOGIES**: Technology-specific implementations and designs
- **I-INFRASTRUCTURES**: Infrastructure and support systems
- **N-NEURAL_NETWORKS**: Neural networks, AI, and governance policies

## Structure

This framework follows the AMPEL360 family architecture, supporting both BWB (Blended Wing Body) and WTW (Wide Tube & Wing) programme variants.

### Shared Spine

The AMPEL360-COMMON shared spine contains content consumed by both WTW and BWB repositories via Git submodule. Changes require PRs governed by the IBCR (Inheritance Boundary Change Request) process.
