description: >
  Envelope protection delta requirements for the AMPEL360 Q100 BWB.
  These requirements supplement SHARED 22-40 requirements with BWB-specific
  alpha/beta limits, structural boundaries, and buffet margins.
  All quantitative thresholds are TBD (LC03) pending aerodynamic and
  structural model maturation.

requirements:
  - req_id: BWB-22-400-001
    shall: >
      The BWB envelope protection system shall limit angle-of-attack (AoA)
      to a maximum of TBD degrees (LC03) below the buffet onset boundary
      for the current Mach number, altitude, and aircraft weight, as
      determined by the BWB aerodynamic model. This limit shall be
      continuously updated in flight using the onboard performance model.
    rationale: >
      The BWB swept composite planform has a different stall/buffet onset
      AoA versus conventional WTW. The SHARED baseline alpha limit is not
      applicable. BWB-specific limits must be derived from wind-tunnel and
      CFD data. This is the core delta from DELTA-BWB-22-003.

  - req_id: BWB-22-400-002
    shall: >
      The BWB envelope protection system shall limit airspeed to below
      VMO/MMO with high-speed protection engagement at VMO minus TBD kts
      (LC03) / MMO minus TBD (LC03), accounting for BWB aeroelastic
      flutter clearance margins specific to the composite flying-wing
      structure.
    rationale: >
      CS-25.253 requires demonstration of freedom from flutter up to VD/MD.
      The BWB composite structure has flutter characteristics that may
      differ from conventional metal airframes, requiring specific VMO/MMO
      margins to be confirmed by flutter analysis at LC03.

  - req_id: BWB-22-400-003
    shall: >
      The BWB envelope protection system shall limit normal load factor (nz)
      to the structural design limits confirmed by the BWB structural
      analysis: maximum TBD g (LC03, target CS-25.337 +2.5 g design limit)
      and minimum TBD g (LC03, target CS-25.337 −1.0 g design limit), with
      protection engagement at TBD g margin below the design limit (LC03).
    rationale: >
      CS-25.337 sets structural limit load factors. BWB composite panel
      load relief characteristics may cause earlier onset of structural
      concern than conventional aluminium structures. Structural analysis
      must confirm the exact protection engagement threshold.

  - req_id: BWB-22-400-004
    shall: >
      The BWB envelope protection system shall limit sideslip angle (beta)
      to TBD degrees (LC03) to remain within the structural lateral load
      limit of the BWB composite planform and within the directional
      stability boundary. Beta limit shall account for the reduced
      directional fin contribution of the BWB layout.
    rationale: >
      The BWB has reduced or no conventional vertical tail contribution to
      directional stability. Beta limits must reflect this reduced fin
      effectiveness and the lateral structural load capacity of the
      composite structure.

  - req_id: BWB-22-400-005
    shall: >
      Envelope protection activation shall generate: (a) a soft alert to
      the flight crew at TBD margin before hard limit engagement (LC03);
      (b) an unambiguous EICAS/ECAM caution upon hard limit engagement;
      and (c) a record in the flight data recorder (FDR) of every
      protection engagement event including parameter, limit, and duration.
    rationale: >
      CS-25.1302 requires timely crew alerting for abnormal conditions.
      FDR recording of protection engagements supports post-flight
      analysis and structural fatigue tracking, which is particularly
      important for the composite BWB structure.
