description: >
  General autoflight delta requirements for the AMPEL360 Q100 BWB variant.
  These requirements supplement the SHARED 22-00 general requirements.
  All quantitative thresholds are TBD (LC03) unless stated.

requirements:
  - req_id: BWB-22-000-001
    shall: >
      The BWB autoflight system shall be designed as a delta overlay on the
      ATA 22 SHARED baseline, adding only those functions and constraints
      required for the BWB flying-wing planform and not covered by the
      SHARED baseline.
    rationale: >
      Ensures modularity and traceability. Prevents duplication of SHARED
      baseline content and maintains a clean delta separation.

    verification: Review
    lc_gate: LC01

  - req_id: BWB-22-000-002
    shall: >
      The BWB autoflight system shall present flight-crew interfaces and
      mode annunciations consistent with the SHARED baseline, except for
      new BWB-specific modes (e.g., CA-RECONFIG, NDI-ENGAGE) which shall
      be clearly identified and documented in the Flight Crew Operating
      Manual supplement.
    rationale: >
      CS-25.1302 requires that installed equipment not increase flight crew
      workload due to novel interface elements without adequate documentation
      and training provision.

    lc_gate: LC03

  - req_id: BWB-22-000-003
    shall: >
      The BWB autoflight system shall be assessed for safety in accordance
      with CS-25.1309 using an Aircraft-Level Functional Hazard Assessment
      (FHA) and System Safety Assessment (SSA) that explicitly cover
      BWB-specific failure modes including: effector loss combinations
      (DELTA-BWB-22-001), NDI divergence (DELTA-BWB-22-002), envelope
      protection failures (DELTA-BWB-22-003), and asymmetric thrust
      (DELTA-BWB-22-005).
    rationale: >
      BWB failure modes differ materially from conventional aircraft due to
      the distributed effector array and non-linear control laws. A
      dedicated FHA/SSA is required to demonstrate compliance.

    lc_gate: LC04

  - req_id: BWB-22-000-004
    shall: >
      All BWB autoflight software functions shall be developed to DO-178C
      Design Assurance Level B (DAL-B) as a minimum, unless a lower
      classification is justified by a fault tree analysis showing the
      function cannot contribute to a Hazardous or Catastrophic failure
      condition.
    rationale: >
      CS-25.1309 FHA expected to classify loss of autoflight as Hazardous
      (10^-7 per flight hour), mandating DAL-B. NDI and control allocation
      are considered safety-critical functions.

    lc_gate: LC03

  - req_id: BWB-22-000-005
    shall: >
      The BWB autoflight architecture shall be compatible with Special
      Condition SC-FCS-001 where the non-linear dynamic inversion control
      law exceeds the scope of conventional CS-25.1329 means of compliance.
      Applicability shall be confirmed with the certifying authority no
      later than LC03.
    rationale: >
      NDI-based control laws may require special conditions beyond AMC
      CS-25.1329 means of compliance, particularly for robustness
      demonstration under non-linear aerodynamic conditions.
