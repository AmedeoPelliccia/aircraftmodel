description: >
  Auto-thrust delta requirements for the AMPEL360 Q100 BWB.
  These requirements supplement SHARED 22-30 requirements with BWB-specific
  4-engine management and asymmetric thrust compensation constraints.
  All quantitative thresholds are TBD (LC03).

requirements:
  - req_id: BWB-22-300-001
    shall: >
      The auto-thrust system shall independently control and monitor the
      thrust of all four (4) engines. The auto-thrust computer shall
      communicate individual thrust demands to each of the four FADECs
      (ENG1–ENG4) via the interfaces defined in
      ICD_BWB_PROPULSION_GUIDANCE_COUPLING_001.md.
    rationale: >
      The SHARED baseline assumes a 2-engine layout with symmetric thrust
      management. The BWB 4-engine configuration requires individual
      channel management to enable asymmetric thrust compensation and
      engine-out handling. This is the core delta from DELTA-BWB-22-005.

  - req_id: BWB-22-300-002
    shall: >
      The auto-thrust system shall implement an asymmetric thrust
      compensation function that: (a) detects inter-engine thrust
      asymmetry exceeding TBD kN (LC03); (b) commands differential
      thrust correction to minimise yaw and roll moments about the
      aircraft centreline; and (c) limits the yaw moment contribution
      from thrust asymmetry to TBD N·m (LC03) during normal autoflight.
    rationale: >
      With 4 engines positioned outboard of the centreline, any thrust
      mismatch creates yaw and roll moments. Uncompensated asymmetry
      would require autoflight to use effector authority for yaw correction,
      reducing stability margins. Active compensation preserves control
      authority for guidance.

  - req_id: BWB-22-300-003
    shall: >
      Following failure of one engine during autoflight, the auto-thrust
      system shall reconfigure to manage the remaining three engines,
      commanding thrust redistribution to minimise net yaw and roll
      asymmetry within TBD seconds (LC03). The autopilot shall remain
      engaged unless the residual asymmetry exceeds the autopilot authority
      limit defined in REQ_BWB_22_100_AUTOPILOT_AND_FD.yaml.
    rationale: >
      Engine-out during autoflight must not result in inadvertent autopilot
      disengagement unless necessary. Rapid thrust redistribution reduces
      workload and preserves autoflight availability.

  - req_id: BWB-22-300-004
    shall: >
      The auto-thrust system shall provide individual engine-out alerting
      to the flight crew within TBD seconds (LC03) of engine failure
      detection during autoflight engagement, consistent with EICAS/ECAM
      alert priority defined in ATA 31/45.
    rationale: >
      CS-25.1302 requires timely and unambiguous crew alerting for
      safety-significant events. Engine-out during autoflight is a
      significant event requiring crew awareness.
