description: >
  Autopilot and flight director delta requirements for the AMPEL360 Q100 BWB.
  These requirements supplement SHARED 22-10 requirements with BWB-specific
  control law (NDI) and effector allocation (CA) constraints.
  All quantitative thresholds are TBD (LC03).

requirements:
  - req_id: BWB-22-100-001
    shall: >
      The BWB autopilot shall implement an explicit model-following
      Non-Linear Dynamic Inversion (NDI) inner loop to decouple pitch
      and heave axes, compensating for the non-linear pitch-heave coupling
      characteristic of the swept flying-wing planform.
    rationale: >
      Linear control laws as used in the SHARED baseline are insufficient
      for the BWB planform where pitch and heave axes are strongly coupled
      non-linearly. NDI provides an explicit inversion of the aerodynamic
      model to achieve decoupled control. This is the key architectural
      delta from DELTA-BWB-22-002.

  - req_id: BWB-22-100-002
    shall: >
      The NDI inner loop shall be augmented with a robustness controller
      (method TBD at LC03, candidates: H∞, μ-synthesis) to maintain
      stability and performance over the full flight envelope and in the
      presence of aerodynamic model uncertainties of TBD magnitude.
    rationale: >
      NDI exact-model-following performance degrades with aerodynamic
      modelling errors. Robustness augmentation is required to demonstrate
      CS-25.1329 and CS-25.143 compliance across all operating conditions.

  - req_id: BWB-22-100-003
    shall: >
      The autopilot shall translate pitch, roll, and yaw moment demands
      from the NDI inner loop through a control allocation module,
      distributing demands across the distributed elevon/spoileron effector
      array in accordance with the effector map defined in
      MODELS/effector_map.yaml.
    rationale: >
      There is no conventional elevator or aileron on the BWB. All autoflight
      surface demands must be resolved through control allocation to the
      distributed trailing-edge array. This is the core delta from
      DELTA-BWB-22-001.

  - req_id: BWB-22-100-004
    shall: >
      The autopilot shall disengage and provide an unambiguous flight crew
      alert within TBD milliseconds (LC03) when: (a) NDI inner loop
      inversion error exceeds TBD threshold (LC03); or (b) the control
      allocation solver fails to find a feasible solution within TBD
      iterations (LC03); or (c) any failure condition classified as
      Hazardous or Catastrophic in the BWB FHA is detected.
    rationale: >
      CS-25.1329(d) requires warning at autopilot disconnect. BWB-specific
      failure modes (NDI divergence, control allocation infeasibility) must
      be monitored in addition to SHARED baseline disconnect conditions.

  - req_id: BWB-22-100-005
    shall: >
      Following autopilot disengagement, the BWB aircraft shall be
      controllable manually by the flight crew using the NDI-derived
      control laws in manual reversion (non-autoflight) mode, with a
      maximum stick force gradient deviation from nominal of TBD N/g (LC03).
    rationale: >
      CS-25.1329(b) requires that autoflight override forces be within
      limits. For BWB, the transition between autoflight and manual control
      must not introduce transients that exceed handling quality limits.

  - req_id: BWB-22-100-006
    shall: >
      The flight director shall display guidance cues derived from the
      NDI outer loop guidance demands. Cue scaling shall account for the
      BWB different pitch-to-flight-path coupling ratio compared to
      conventional aircraft. Scaling values are TBD (LC03).
    rationale: >
      The BWB pitch-to-flight-path gain differs from conventional aircraft.
      SHARED flight director cue scaling may not be appropriate and could
      induce pilot-induced oscillations (PIO) if not corrected.
