description: >
  FMS guidance delta requirements for the AMPEL360 Q100 BWB.
  These requirements supplement SHARED 22-20 requirements with BWB-specific
  performance polar and flight profile optimisation constraints.
  All quantitative thresholds are TBD (LC03).

requirements:
  - req_id: BWB-22-200-001
    shall: >
      The FMS shall use BWB-specific aerodynamic performance tables (L/D
      vs Mach, altitude, and aircraft weight) for all VNAV speed and
      altitude optimisation functions including: ECON speed schedule,
      optimum cruise altitude, step climb criteria, and descent profile
      management. These tables shall be distinct from and shall not be
      overwritten by any WTW performance dataset.
    rationale: >
      The BWB aerodynamic polar differs materially from WTW due to the
      flying-wing planform. Using WTW performance tables for BWB would
      result in sub-optimal cruise performance and potentially incorrect
      VNAV guidance targets. This is the core delta from DELTA-BWB-22-004.

  - req_id: BWB-22-200-002
    shall: >
      The BWB FMS ECON Mach number shall be derived from the BWB cost
      index (CI) and the BWB L/D polar, yielding a value of TBD Mach
      (LC03). The FMS shall alert the crew if a manually selected Mach
      deviates from ECON by more than TBD (LC04).
    rationale: >
      The BWB optimum cruise Mach is likely different from WTW due to
      different profile drag characteristics of the blended wing body.
      The crew alert threshold ensures awareness of fuel penalty when
      off-ECON speed.

  - req_id: BWB-22-200-003
    shall: >
      The FMS shall compute step climb recommendations using BWB weight/
      altitude/temperature (WAT) performance data. Step climb altitude
      increments and trigger weights are TBD (LC03).
    rationale: >
      BWB step-climb crossover weights and altitudes may differ from WTW
      because of the different lift curve slope and cruise polar shape.
      Incorrect step-climb recommendations lead to fuel burn penalties.

  - req_id: BWB-22-200-004
    shall: >
      The FMS shall provide VNAV descent profile management using a BWB-
      specific drag polar. The top-of-descent point and idle descent profile
      shall be computed from BWB specific glide performance. Values TBD (LC03).
    rationale: >
      BWB descent performance (glide ratio at idle thrust) differs from WTW.
      Incorrect top-of-descent computation could result in arriving at
      destination above or below the cleared descent profile.
