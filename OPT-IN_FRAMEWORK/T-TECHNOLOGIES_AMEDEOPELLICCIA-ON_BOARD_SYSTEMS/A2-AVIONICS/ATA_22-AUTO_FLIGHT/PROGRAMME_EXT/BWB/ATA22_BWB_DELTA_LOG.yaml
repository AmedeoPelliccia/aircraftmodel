    description: >
      Initial identification of distributed effector allocation delta.
      BWB trailing-edge elevon/spoileron array topology documented as
      architectural deviation from SHARED baseline. Control allocation
      matrix structure defined at stub level.

      - BWB-22-100-002
    notes: >
      Effector map numerical parameters (deflection limits, authority
      distribution) deferred to LC03 pending aerodynamic model maturation.

    delta_ref: DELTA-BWB-22-002
    description: >
      Initial identification of NDI control law delta. Non-linear
      pitch-heave coupling confirmed as requiring explicit model-following
      NDI architecture. Robustness augmentation method (H∞ vs μ-synthesis)
      remains TBD.

    notes: >
      Control law stability analysis (ANALYSIS_BWB_CONTROL_LAW_STABILITY_CS25_1329.md)
      is stub; full analysis requires non-linear aerodynamic model at LC03.
      DO-178C DAL-B software classification confirmed.

    delta_ref: DELTA-BWB-22-003
    description: >
      Initial identification of envelope protection delta. BWB swept
      composite planform introduces different alpha/beta limits, buffet
      boundary, and load factor constraints vs WTW. All threshold values TBD.

    notes: >
      Buffet onset margin and structural stall boundary to be derived from
      wind-tunnel and CFD data at LC03. CS-25.253 high-speed characteristics
      assessment required.

  - change_id: CHG-0004
    delta_ref: DELTA-BWB-22-004
    description: >
      Initial identification of FMS performance polar delta. BWB L/D
      characteristic differs from WTW; ECON speed, optimum altitude, and
      VNAV profile management require BWB-specific performance tables.

      Deferred to LC03. FMS database update process to be defined at LC04.

    delta_ref: DELTA-BWB-22-005
    description: >
      Initial identification of propulsion guidance coupling delta. 4×
      distributed engine layout creates inter-engine thrust asymmetry
      management requirements not covered by SHARED 2-engine baseline.

      Engine thrust model and FADEC interface ICD to be matured at LC03.
      Yaw compensation authority budget for asymmetric thrust TBD.
