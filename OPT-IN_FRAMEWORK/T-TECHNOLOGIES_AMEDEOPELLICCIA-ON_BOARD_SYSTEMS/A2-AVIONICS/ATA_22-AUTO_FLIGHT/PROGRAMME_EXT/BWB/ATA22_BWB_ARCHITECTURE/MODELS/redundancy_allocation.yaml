description: >
  Stub allocation of FCC and actuator redundancy for the AMPEL360 Q100 BWB
  autoflight system. Captures BWB-specific redundancy considerations beyond
  the SHARED baseline. Detailed allocation deferred to LC04 pending FCC
  platform selection and actuator sizing.

fcc_redundancy:
  architecture: TBD  # e.g. triplex, dual-dual — LC02/LC04
  voting_logic: TBD  # LC04
  dissimilarity_required: TBD  # DO-178C / SC-FCS-001 TBD LC03
  ndi_module_redundancy: >
    NDI inner loop hosted on FCC. Redundancy level must match DAL-B
    software classification. Physical redundancy approach TBD (LC04).
  dal_level: B  # DO-178C DAL-B confirmed

actuator_redundancy:
  policy: >
    Each effector segment (IE, ME, OE, SP) shall have independent actuator
    channels. Minimum channel redundancy per segment TBD at LC04.
  inboard_elevon:
    channels_per_side: TBD  # LC04
    failure_mode: TBD
  mid_elevon:
    channels_per_side: TBD  # LC04
    failure_mode: TBD
  outboard_elevon:
    channels_per_side: TBD  # LC04
    failure_mode: TBD
  spoileron:
    channels_per_side: TBD  # LC04
    failure_mode: TBD

power_supply_segregation:
  approach: TBD  # LC04
  notes: "4-engine electrical generation redundancy interfaces with ATA 24"

cs25_1309_target:
  autoflight_loss_probability: TBD  # Extremely remote — CS-25.1309 LC04 FHA
  autoflight_malfunction_probability: TBD  # LC04
