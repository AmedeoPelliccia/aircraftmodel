description: >
  Delta-overlay index for ATA 22 Auto Flight BWB programme extension.
  This overlay covers only BWB-specific deviations from the SHARED baseline.
  All entries are stub-level; quantitative values deferred to LC03+.

    title: "Distributed Elevon/Spoileron Effector Allocation for Autoflight"
    type: ΔARCH
    status: DRAFT
    lc_gate: LC01
    description: >
      BWB replaces conventional elevator and aileron with a distributed
      trailing-edge array of elevons and spoilerons. Auto-flight commands
      must be translated through a control allocation matrix rather than
      direct surface deflection. Differs from SHARED baseline assumption
      of conventional surface geometry.

    title: "Non-Linear Dynamic Inversion (NDI) Control Laws"
    type: ΔARCH
    status: DRAFT
    lc_gate: LC01
    description: >
      BWB pitch-heave coupling is non-linear due to the swept flying-wing
      planform. The SHARED baseline linear control law architecture is
      insufficient. BWB requires explicit model-following NDI with robustness
      augmentation (H∞ or μ-synthesis TBD at LC03).

    type: ΔREQ
    status: DRAFT
    lc_gate: LC01
    description: >
      Stall, buffet, alpha/beta limits, and structural load factor boundaries
      are specific to the BWB swept composite planform and differ substantially
      from WTW values. All thresholds are TBD pending aerodynamic model
      maturation at LC03.

    type: ΔREQ
    status: DRAFT
    lc_gate: LC01
    description: >
      BWB has a different aerodynamic polar (L/D vs Mach/altitude) compared
      to WTW. FMS guidance modes (VNAV, ECON speed, optimum altitude) must
      use BWB-specific performance tables. Tables are TBD at LC03.

    title: "Propulsion Guidance Coupling — 4× Distributed Engine Management"
    type: ΔARCH
    status: DRAFT
    lc_gate: LC01
    description: >
      The AMPEL360 Q100 BWB has 4 engines distributed symmetrically about
      the fuselage centreline. Auto-thrust must manage asymmetric thrust
      conditions and inter-engine coupling effects not present in the SHARED
      baseline (which assumes 2-engine conventional layout).
