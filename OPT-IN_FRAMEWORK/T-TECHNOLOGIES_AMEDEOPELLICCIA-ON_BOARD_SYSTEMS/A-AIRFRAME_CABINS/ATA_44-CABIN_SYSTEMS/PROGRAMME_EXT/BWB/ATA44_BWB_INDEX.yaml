      - ATA44_BWB_REQUIREMENTS/REQ_BWB_44_100_CABIN_CORE.yaml
    rationale: "BWB has no single E/E bay; CMS controllers distributed per spar bay to minimise inter-bay cabling mass and latency"
    impact:
      safety: medium
      certification: "CS-25.1309, ED-14G (DO-160G)"

      - ATA44_BWB_ARCHITECTURE/MODELS/zone_map.yaml
      - ATA44_BWB_REQUIREMENTS/REQ_BWB_44_100_CABIN_CORE.yaml
    rationale: "BWB zones defined by spar bay (structural) boundaries AND radial angular segments; differs from WTW linear zone topology"
    impact:
      safety: low

      - ATA44_BWB_REQUIREMENTS/REQ_BWB_44_100_CABIN_CORE.yaml
    rationale: "Spar bay structural boundaries require AFDX network segmentation per bay with dedicated inter-bay bridge switches; increases latency budget complexity"
    impact:
      safety: medium

    type: [ICD]
    files:
      - ATA44_BWB_INTERFACES/ICD_BWB_HARNESS_ROUTING_001.md
    rationale: "BWB harness must penetrate spar bay structures at defined doubler/grommet locations; routing envelope per bay differs from WTW continuous run"
    impact:
      safety: low

      - ATA44_BWB_REQUIREMENTS/REQ_BWB_44_100_CABIN_CORE.yaml
    rationale: "VL allocation, port assignment, and bridge switch addresses are BWB-specific; cannot share WTW endpoint register"

      - ATA44_BWB_REQUIREMENTS/REQ_BWB_44_200_IFE.yaml
    rationale: "BWB has no single IFE server bay; per-bay IFE distribution nodes required to avoid cross-spar-bay content streaming over inter-bay bridge"

      - ATA44_BWB_VERIFICATION_EVIDENCE/TEST_BWB_CMS_FUNCTIONAL_44_10.md
    rationale: "BWB smoke/temp sensor loops partitioned per spar bay; smoke event must be localised to bay without relying on inter-bay bridge availability"
