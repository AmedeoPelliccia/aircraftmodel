subchapter: "44-30"
title: "External Communication — BWB Antenna Placement"
variant: BWB
revision: RevA
lc_gate: LC01

requirements:
  - req_id: BWB-44-300-001
    shall: "External communication antennas SHALL be placed on the BWB lower surface consistent with BWB fuselage envelope constraints. Placement SHALL avoid structural spar bay attachment points."
    rationale: "BWB outer mould line differs from WTW circular fuselage. Antenna positions must be derived from BWB structural and aerodynamic surface definitions."
    cs25_ref: "CS-25.1353"
    verification: inspection
    lc_gate: LC05

  - req_id: BWB-44-300-002
    shall: "RF emissions from external communication antennas SHALL comply with ETSI EN 303 360 at all BWB antenna installation positions."
    rationale: "BWB composite skin may have different shielding effectiveness than WTW metallic fuselage. RF compliance must be re-verified for BWB geometry."
    cs25_ref: null
    verification: test
    lc_gate: LC07
