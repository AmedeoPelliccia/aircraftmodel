requirements:
  - req_id: BWB-44-600-001
    shall: "CMS software SHALL support dynamic zone reconfiguration to reassign sensor monitoring from a failed ZC to an adjacent bay ZC via BBU, without requiring physical access."
    rationale: "Distributed ZC architecture increases the likelihood of partial system degradation. Software reconfiguration reduces crew workload and maintenance costs."

    shall: "All BWB CMS LRUs (ZC, BBU, IBN) SHALL be compliant with ED-14G (DO-160G) environmental conditions applicable to the installed bay environment."
    rationale: "Per-bay environmental conditions may differ from centralised E/E bay used in WTW. Environmental qualification per bay required."
