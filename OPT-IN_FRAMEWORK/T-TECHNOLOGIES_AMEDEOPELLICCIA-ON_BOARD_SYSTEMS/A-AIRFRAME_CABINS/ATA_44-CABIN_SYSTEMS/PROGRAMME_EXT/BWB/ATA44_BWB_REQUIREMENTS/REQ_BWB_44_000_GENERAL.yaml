subchapter: "44-000"
title: "General — BWB Applicability"
variant: BWB
revision: RevA
lc_gate: LC01

requirements:
  - req_id: BWB-44-000-001
    shall: "The ATA 44 BWB overlay SHALL apply only to the AMPEL360 BWB variant. All requirements herein are deltas to the ATA 44 SHARED baseline."
    rationale: "Prevent misapplication to WTW variant. WTW uses a centralised CMC/CAC topology not applicable to BWB."
    cs25_ref: null
    verification: analysis
    lc_gate: LC01

  - req_id: BWB-44-000-002
    shall: "The BWB cabin systems architecture SHALL use a per-spar-bay distributed Zone Controller (ZC) topology in lieu of a centralised CMC."
    rationale: "BWB composite planform creates multiple spar bays that impose structural constraints on harness routing. Centralised CMC is impractical."
    cs25_ref: "CS-25.1309"

    lc_gate: LC03

  - req_id: BWB-44-000-003
    shall: "No ATA 44 CMS harness SHALL bridge more than one spar bay structural boundary via a single uninterrupted run without a Bay Bridge Unit (BBU) at the boundary."
    rationale: "Structural spar bay boundaries require grommet/doubler penetrations. Uninterrupted routing of large bundles across multiple boundaries is structurally impractical and maintenance-heavy."
