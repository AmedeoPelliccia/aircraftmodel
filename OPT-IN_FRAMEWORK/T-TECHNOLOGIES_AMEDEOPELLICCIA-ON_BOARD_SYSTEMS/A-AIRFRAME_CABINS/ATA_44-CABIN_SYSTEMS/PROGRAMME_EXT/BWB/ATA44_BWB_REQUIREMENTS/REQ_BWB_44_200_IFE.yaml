variant: BWB
revision: RevA

requirements:
  - req_id: BWB-44-200-001
    shall: "Each spar bay SHALL have at least one IFE Bay Node (IBN) providing local content distribution to seats within that bay."
    rationale: "BWB per-bay IFE topology eliminates high-bandwidth content streaming across inter-bay bridges (BBU), which have limited bandwidth budgets."

  - req_id: BWB-44-200-002
    shall: "IFE Bay Nodes SHALL synchronise content metadata across bays via the BBU at a bandwidth not exceeding TBD Mbit/s [LC04 gate]."
    rationale: "Inter-bay bridge bandwidth is shared with CMS safety-essential data. IFE sync must be low-bandwidth (metadata only) to avoid congestion."

  - req_id: BWB-44-200-003
    shall: "All IFE Bay Node materials and LRU enclosures SHALL comply with CS-25.853(a) flammability requirements."
    rationale: "Distributed IBN LRUs are inside the pressure vessel. Flammability compliance required for all materials per certification basis."
