**EVI ID:** T-A-ATA44-WTW-EVI-006
**Delta Refs:** DELTA-WTW-44-003
**Req Refs:** WTW-44-100-004, WTW-44-000-003
**Standard:** CS-25.1353
**Status:** OPEN — Target LC06
**Parent:** [Evidence README](README.md)

## 1) Objective

Demonstrate by first-article and production-line inspection that the WTW ATA 44 crown
and sidewall harness routing meets the spatial separation requirements of CS-25.1353.

---

## 2) Inspection Scope

| Item | Check | Method | Pass Criterion |
|------|-------|--------|---------------|
| Crown AFDX harness: bend radii | Measure at all direction changes | Visual + tape measure | ≥ TBD × cable OD |
| Crown harness: bulkhead grommet seating | Visual at each zone boundary | Visual | Full seating, no gap |
| Harness separation from ATA 26 smoke loops | Measure minimum gap | Tape measure | ≥ TBD mm (CS-25.1353 Zone B) |
| Harness tie spacing | Measure all tie intervals | Visual + tape measure | ≤ TBD mm (ATA 20 standard) |
| Sidewall audio harness separation from crown AFDX harness | Measure minimum gap at co-routed sections | Tape measure | ≥ TBD mm (isolation from AFDX per network ICD) |

---

## 3) Inspection Trigger

- First-article inspection (FAI) at ground test aircraft build.
- Production conformity inspection per AMM ATA 44 section.

## 4) Open Actions

| Action | Owner | Target LC |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| Define all inspection limits (bend radius, tie spacing, separation) | Avionics Inst. Eng / Certification | LC04 |
| Publish inspection procedure in AMM ATA 44 draft | Publications | LC05 |
| Conduct FAI inspection and issue report | Quality / Test | LC06 |
