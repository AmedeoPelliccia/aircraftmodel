  - req_id: WTW-44-200-001
    shall: "The WTW IFE Media Server shall be installed in the FWD avionics bay per
            ICD T-A-ATA44-WTW-ICD-004. No IFE server shall be installed in the pressurised
            underfloor area."
    rationale: "WTW has no pressurised underfloor IFE equipment bay — servers are E/E bay
                resident. BWB may use distributed underfloor servers."
