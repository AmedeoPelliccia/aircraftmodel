requirements:
  - req_id: WTW-44-300-001
    shall: "The WTW satcom antenna (ANT-44-01) shall be installed on the fuselage crown at
            the FS position defined in ICD T-A-ATA44-WTW-ICD-005. The installation shall not
            encroach upon the AFDX crown harness envelope per ICD T-A-ATA44-WTW-ICD-002."
    rationale: "Crown harness run and satcom antenna occupy the same crown zone; geometric
                co-existence must be verified."

    verification: inspection

  - req_id: WTW-44-300-002
    shall: "The CFRP crown panels in the satcom antenna aperture zone shall demonstrate
            RF transparency within the Ka/Ku band (10.7–14.5 GHz) with maximum attenuation
            TBD dB. Evidence: RF transparency test on representative panel samples."
    rationale: "CFRP is conductive and may attenuate satcom signals; attenuation limit TBD
                at LC04 from antenna supplier RF budget."

  - req_id: WTW-44-300-003
    shall: "All external communication systems shall comply with applicable ETSI or FCC
            radio frequency regulations (ETSI EN 303 360 for satcom). Evidence: RF
            compliance test per TEST_WTW_RF_COMPLIANCE.md."
    rationale: "Regulatory compliance for passenger connectivity services."
