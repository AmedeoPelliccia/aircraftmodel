requirements:
  - req_id: WTW-44-100-001
    shall: "The CMS Main Controller (CMC) shall be located in the FWD E/E bay in the LRU
            cabinet row defined by ICD T-A-ATA44-WTW-ICD-001."
    rationale: "WTW FWD E/E bay provides controlled environment, short harness run to avionics,
                and access via standard E/E bay access panels."

  - req_id: WTW-44-100-002
    shall: "A redundant CMS AFT Controller (CAC) shall be located in the AFT equipment bay
            per ICD T-A-ATA44-WTW-ICD-001. The CAC shall assume full CMS primary functionality
            within TBD s of CMC failure."
    rationale: "Failover requirement for cabin core system loss (Category III failure condition)."

  - req_id: WTW-44-100-003
    shall: "The WTW cabin shall be divided into 2–4 longitudinal zones per ARCH document
            T-A-ATA44-WTW-ARCH-002. Zone boundaries shall align with structural bulkheads
            or seat-row breaks."
    rationale: "Longitudinal zone topology is specific to WTW tube fuselage. BWB uses
                radial zones driven by bay geometry."

  - req_id: WTW-44-100-004
    shall: "The WTW cabin ARINC 664 Part 7 backbone shall run as a continuous longitudinal
            harness from FS_start to FS_end per ICD T-A-ATA44-WTW-ICD-002, with no
            inter-bay bridge units required."
    rationale: "Δ WTW: No structural spar bay interrupts the harness run. BWB requires
                bridge units at each spar bay penetration."

  - req_id: WTW-44-100-005
    shall: "ARINC 664 Virtual Link (VL) IDs and port allocations for all WTW ATA 44
            endpoints shall be defined in ICD T-A-ATA44-WTW-ICD-003 and
            MODELS/icd_endpoints.yaml, populated by LC03."
    rationale: "Early VL allocation prevents conflicts with ATA 46 and other cabin avionics
                sharing the cabin AFDX domain."
