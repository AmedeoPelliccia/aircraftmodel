status: DRAFT
revision: RevA
baseline_ref: T-A-ATA44-001

requirements:
  - req_id: WTW-44-600-001
    shall: "Any WTW cabin systems provisions not covered by subchapters 44-10 through 44-50
            (e.g., galley entertainment interface, reading light control integration) shall
            be captured as delta requirements in this file or escalated to SHARED baseline
            if applicable to both variants."
    rationale: "Catchall for miscellaneous WTW-specific CMS deltas not fitting a defined
                subchapter. Prevents ungoverned requirements."

  - req_id: WTW-44-600-002
    shall: "WTW passenger address (PA) system integration with CMS shall use the dedicated
            audio bus defined in ICD T-A-ATA44-WTW-ICD-002 (sidewall harness run) and
            shall not share the AFDX backbone VL reserved for CMS data."
    rationale: "PA/audio is safety-related (evacuation announcements); must be isolated
                from entertainment/CMS data traffic."
