requirements:
  - req_id: WTW-44-500-001
    shall: "The WTW cabin monitoring system shall provide at least one smoke detector per
            cabin zone and per lavatory, using a ring/bus topology driven from the CMS
            zone satellite unit (CSU) per zone."
    rationale: "WTW uses conventional ring/bus sensor topology; sensor count driven by
                the circular cross-section and linear zone layout."

  - req_id: WTW-44-500-002
    shall: "The WTW cabin temperature monitoring system shall provide cabin temperature
            readings per zone with accuracy TBD ± TBD°C. Sensor positions TBD at LC03
            from HVAC analysis (ATA 21 interface)."
    rationale: "Cabin temperature monitoring feeds ECS (ATA 21) and CMS comfort management."

  - req_id: WTW-44-500-003
    shall: "Passenger-seat occupancy sensing (if fitted) shall use a sensor system compatible
            with WTW seat track attachment and shall interface to the CMS CSU via the
            cabin AFDX network per ICD T-A-ATA44-WTW-ICD-003."
    rationale: "Occupancy sensing for load management; sensor type TBD at LC03 (seat
                weight-on-leg or PIR)."
