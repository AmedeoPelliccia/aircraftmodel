status: DRAFT
revision: RevA
baseline_ref: T-A-ATA44-001

requirements:
  - req_id: WTW-44-000-001
    shall: "The WTW CMS shall conform to the SHARED ATA 44 baseline (T-A-ATA44-001) except
            where explicitly superseded by delta statements in this overlay."
    rationale: "Establishes precedence rule; avoids duplication of SHARED content."
    cs25_ref: null
    verification: analysis
    lc_gate: LC01

  - req_id: WTW-44-000-002
    shall: "All WTW ATA 44 LRUs shall satisfy ED-14G (DO-160G) environmental qualification
            appropriate to their installation location (Equipment Category per ED-14G Table 1-2)."
    rationale: "Environmental qualification is installation-location-dependent; WTW E/E bay
                category may differ from BWB equivalent position."

  - req_id: WTW-44-000-003
    shall: "Wiring separation between WTW ATA 44 harnesses and other aircraft systems shall
            meet CS-25.1353 requirements. Minimum separation from fuel system lines shall be
            TBD mm — to be determined at LC04."
    rationale: "WTW harness routing is longitudinal (crown/sidewall); no fuel system in
                cabin crown, but proximity to ATA 26 loops and ATA 28 filler necks must be checked."
