      delta_id: DELTA-BWB-50-001
      title: Multi-bay flat-deck cargo compartment envelope
      author: TBD
      date: TBD
      lc_gate: LC01
      status: OPEN
      description: >
        Introduces BWB-specific cargo compartment envelope definition for the
        distributed multi-bay flat-deck cargo architecture. Each structural bay
        bounded by consecutive spar webs has its own envelope: floor node
        coordinates, usable width/height, and net usable volume.
        Differs fundamentally from WTW circular belly-hold constraint.

      title: Side-access cargo door geometry and latch/hinge ICD (per bay)
      author: TBD
      date: TBD
      lc_gate: LC01
      status: OPEN
      description: >
        Defines BWB side-access (wing lower surface) cargo door clear-opening
        dimensions, sill height above lower skin, hinge pin locations and
        latch mechanism ICD per bay. Configuration differs from WTW
        upward-opening belly plug door.

      title: Flat-panel liner attachment scheme (spar-boundary aware)
      author: TBD
      date: TBD
      lc_gate: LC01
      status: OPEN
      description: >
        Liner attachment rail locations follow composite spar frame pitch in
        the flat-floor BWB deck. Rail type and clip spacing differ from the
        WTW curved fuselage rail/clip scheme. No panel may span a spar bay
        boundary; each panel is self-contained within one bay.

      title: Distributed drain/vent routing via spar bay penetrations
      author: TBD
      date: TBD
      lc_gate: LC01
      status: OPEN
      description: >
        Drain and vent paths route through dedicated spar penetration fittings
        (grommet/doubler per structural boundary) to a lower wing skin exit
        point per bay. Each bay has its own collect point and drain mast.
        Differs from WTW keel-line routing.

      title: Bay-partitioned fire containment liner interfaces
      author: TBD
      date: TBD
      lc_gate: LC01
      status: OPEN
      description: >
        Fire containment liner is partitioned per structural bay using spar
        web fire-stops as bay boundaries. Panel seam gap at spar-adjacent
        joints and spar penetration fire-stop geometry define fire
        classification per CS-25.855/856.

      title: Cargo net/restraint attach interfaces at spar bay frames
      author: TBD
      date: TBD
      lc_gate: LC01
      status: OPEN
      description: >
        Restraint attach fittings are located on composite spar frame floor
        nodes within each bay. Metallic insert design for load introduction
        into composite spar web defined at LC05 after FEA.

    - change_id: CHG-0007
      delta_id: DELTA-BWB-50-007
      title: Bay-to-bay access provisions through spar penetrations
      author: TBD
      date: TBD
      lc_gate: LC01
      status: OPEN
      description: >
        Inter-bay access requires spar penetration openings (manholes or
        hatches) reinforced per composite spar repair manual. Opening geometry,
        reinforcement doublers and fire/pressure sealing are BWB-only
        requirements not present in WTW.
