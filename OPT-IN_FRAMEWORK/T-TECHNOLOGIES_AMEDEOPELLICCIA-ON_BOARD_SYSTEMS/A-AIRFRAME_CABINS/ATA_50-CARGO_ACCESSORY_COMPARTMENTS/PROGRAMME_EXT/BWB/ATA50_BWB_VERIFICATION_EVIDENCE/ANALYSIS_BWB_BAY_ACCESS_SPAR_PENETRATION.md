# ANALYSIS-BWB-50-003 — BWB Bay Access Spar Penetration Fire-Stop Analysis (AMC 25.857)

**Evidence ID:** EVI-BWB-50-003
**Type:** Analysis
**Programme:** AMPEL360 BWB
**Delta:** DELTA-BWB-50-005 / DELTA-BWB-50-007
**Regulation:** AMC 25.857 — Bay fire-stop at spar penetrations
**LC Gate:** LC04
**Status:** STUB — actual analysis produced at LC04

## 1. Objective

Demonstrate that spar web fire-stops (including all penetrations for drain tubes,
wiring conduits and bay access hatches) maintain the fire containment classification
of adjacent cargo bays per CS-25.855/856/857 and AMC 25.857.

## 2. Scope

- Spar web thermal analysis under fire conditions.
- Penetration fitting thermal performance (grommet/doubler, intumescent seal).
- Bay access hatch seal performance under fire exposure.
- Structural integrity of spar web during fire scenario.

## 3. Method (Planned)

- Thermal FEA of spar web with fire condition applied to one bay face.
- Penetration fitting and intumescent seal modelled per material specification.
- Temperature at opposite bay face compared to CS-25.855 limit.
- Bay access hatch seal compression loss modelled under thermal expansion.

## 4. Inputs Required (TBD at LC04)

- Intumescent seal specification (material properties, activation temperature).
- Fire containment liner class per bay (from fire protection analysis).
- Spar web material (composite/metallic) thermal properties.
- Penetration fitting geometry from ICD-BWB-50-004.

## 5. Success Criteria

- Temperature at protected bay face ≤ CS-25.855 limit under fire scenario.
- Intumescent seal remains effective for duration of fire scenario.
- Bay access hatch seal does not degrade to failure within fire scenario duration.

## 6. Evidence Reference

Report number: TBD (assigned at LC04)
