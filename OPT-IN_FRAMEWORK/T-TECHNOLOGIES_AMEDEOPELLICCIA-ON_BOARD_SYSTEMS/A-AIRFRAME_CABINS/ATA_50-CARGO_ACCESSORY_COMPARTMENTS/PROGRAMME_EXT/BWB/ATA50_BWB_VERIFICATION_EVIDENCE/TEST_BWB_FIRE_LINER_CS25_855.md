# TEST-BWB-50-001 — BWB Bay-Partitioned Cargo Fire Liner Test (CS-25.855/856/857)

**Evidence ID:** EVI-BWB-50-004
**Type:** Test
**Programme:** AMPEL360 BWB
**Delta:** DELTA-BWB-50-005
**Regulation:** CS-25.855, CS-25.856, CS-25.857
**LC Gate:** LC05
**Status:** STUB — actual test conducted at LC05

## 1. Objective

Demonstrate per-bay fire containment liner compliance with CS-25.855 (classification),
CS-25.856 (liner material), and CS-25.857 (fire protection) for the BWB bay-partitioned
cargo compartment configuration.

## 2. Test Scope

- Representative test article: one structural bay section with spar web fire-stops on
  both bay boundaries, flat-panel liner installed per ICD-BWB-50-003, fire-stop seals,
  and representative drain/vent penetration fittings.
- Fire source: standard ignition source per AMC 25.857.
- Duration: per CS-25.857 classification duration requirement.

## 3. Test Configuration

- Bay geometry: representative of BAY-C2 (or most critical bay per analysis).
- Spar web fire-stop seals: intumescent seal to specification (TBD at LC04).
- Liner panels: production representative flat panels per ICD-BWB-50-003.
- Drain tube penetration fittings: production representative.
- All panel seam gaps set to maximum allowable (worst case per ACC_BWB_INSTALLATION_LIMITS).

## 4. Acceptance Criteria

- No fire breakthrough to adjacent bay during test duration.
- Liner panel does not contribute to fire spread beyond allowable CS-25.856 limit.
- Spar web fire-stop integrity maintained throughout test.
- Intumescent seals perform as designed.

## 5. Test Sample

- Minimum one full bay section (TBD number of repeat tests, LC05).
- Per-bay fire class confirmed prior to test based on fire protection analysis (TBD LC04).

## 6. Evidence Reference

Test report number: TBD (assigned at LC05)
