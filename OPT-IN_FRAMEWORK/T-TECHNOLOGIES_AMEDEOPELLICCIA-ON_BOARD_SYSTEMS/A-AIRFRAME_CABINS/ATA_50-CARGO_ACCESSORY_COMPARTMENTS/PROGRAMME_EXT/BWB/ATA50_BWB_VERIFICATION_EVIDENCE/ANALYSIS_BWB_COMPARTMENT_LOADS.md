# ANALYSIS-BWB-50-001 — BWB Cargo Compartment Pressurised Loads Analysis

**Evidence ID:** EVI-BWB-50-001
**Type:** Analysis
**Programme:** AMPEL360 BWB
**Delta:** DELTA-BWB-50-001
**Regulation:** CS-25.365 — Pressurised compartment loads
**LC Gate:** LC04
**Status:** STUB — actual analysis produced at LC04

## 1. Objective

Demonstrate that the multi-bay flat-deck BWB cargo compartment structure sustains
the pressurised compartment load cases per CS-25.365, with load distributed
independently per structural bay.

## 2. Scope

- Per-bay floor node loads from fuselage/wing-box pressurisation.
- Spar web loading at bay boundaries from differential pressure.
- Interaction between adjacent bays at spar boundary nodes.
- Floor deflection under design limit load (DLL) and design ultimate load (DUL).

## 3. Method (Planned)

- FEA of wing-box structure with pressurisation loading applied per bay.
- Load cases per CS-25.365 (burst pressurisation, combined with flight loads).
- Bay envelope confirmed from ICD-BWB-50-001 geometry.
- Spar penetration fitting loads extracted for drain/vent fitting sizing.

## 4. Inputs Required (TBD at LC04)

- Final bay geometry from ICD-BWB-50-001.
- Pressurisation differential TBD psi.
- Combined load cases (pressurisation + manoeuvre) from loads report.

## 5. Success Criteria

- Floor node deflection ≤ TBD mm at DLL.
- No spar web yielding at DLL; no fracture at DUL.
- Spar penetration fitting loads within fitting certification limits.

## 6. Evidence Reference

Report number: TBD (assigned at LC04)
