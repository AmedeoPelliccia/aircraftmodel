# INSPECTION-BWB-50-002 — BWB Cargo Bay Drain/Vent Inspection (CS-25.1001/CS-25.1103)

**Evidence ID:** EVI-BWB-50-006
**Type:** Inspection
**Programme:** AMPEL360 BWB
**Delta:** DELTA-BWB-50-004
**Regulation:** CS-25.1001, CS-25.1103
**LC Gate:** LC04
**Status:** STUB — actual inspection conducted at LC04 (first article)

## 1. Objective

Verify that BWB per-bay drain/vent routing and spar penetration fittings meet:
- CS-25.1001 (drain requirements — capacity and routing)
- CS-25.1103 (cargo compartment ventilation)

## 2. Inspection Scope

- All per-bay spar penetration drain fittings (one per bay boundary): BAY-C1 through BAY-C4.
- Per-bay drain collect points (floor lowest point per bay).
- Drain mast installations on lower wing skin.
- Vent path routing per bay.
- Sealant application at all spar penetration fittings.

## 3. Inspection Method

- Visual inspection of all drain fittings, tubes and masts.
- Flow test: drain rate per bay under simulated ingress (pour test, TBD procedure).
- Sealant inspection: confirm 100% faying area coverage at each spar penetration fitting.
- Ventilation flow check: confirm air change rate per bay per CS-25.1103.
- Leak test: confirm no pressurisation leakage at spar penetration fittings.

## 4. Acceptance Criteria

- Drain capacity per bay ≥ TBD L/min per CS-25.1001 (LC04).
- Sealant coverage: 100% of faying area at all spar penetration fittings.
- No pressurisation leakage at fittings under TBD differential (LC04).
- Ventilation air change rate per bay ≥ TBD per CS-25.1103 (LC04).
- Drain mast aligned within TBD deg of design axis.

## 5. Evidence Reference

Inspection record number: TBD (assigned at LC04)
