# ICD-BWB-50-003 — Flat-Panel Liner Attachment Scheme (Spar-Boundary Aware)

**Delta:** DELTA-BWB-50-003
**Programme:** AMPEL360 BWB
**ATA:** 50 — Cargo & Accessory Compartments
**Baseline ref:** ATA50-SHARED §5
**LC Gate:** LC04
**Status:** TBD

## 1. Scope

This ICD defines the BWB-specific flat-panel liner attachment scheme for the
distributed multi-bay cargo deck. Liner panels are flat (not curved), attached
via rails parallel to spar lines, and must not span spar bay boundaries.

## 2. BWB Delta Statement

**ΔICD vs. SHARED:** SHARED baseline defines generic liner attachment.
The BWB overlay redefines liner as flat panels with spar-parallel rails,
replacing the WTW curved rail/clip scheme on the circular fuselage skin.
The no-bay-bridge rule (BWB-50-000-003) applies to liner panels.

## 3. Liner Panel Properties

| Property | BWB Value | WTW Equivalent |
|----------|-----------|----------------|
| Panel form | Flat | Curved (fuselage skin radius) |
| Attachment rail | Spar-parallel flat rail | Curved clip/rail |
| Max panel span (spanwise) | Within one bay only | Full belly hold width |
| Panel material | TBD composite or aluminium honeycomb | TBD |
| Panel thickness | TBD mm | TBD mm |
| Fire classification | Class C/E per bay | Class C/E |

## 4. Attachment Rail Specification

- Rail orientation: parallel to aft spar, installed on floor structure.
- Rail spacing (chordwise pitch): TBD mm (LC04 after FEA).
- Clip type: TBD (positive-retention quarter-turn fastener recommended).
- Rail-to-structure fastener: TBD torque per ATA 20 SHARED fastener standard.
- Spar boundary termination: panel edge must terminate within TBD mm of spar web face.

## 5. Spar Boundary Rules

- No liner panel SHALL extend across a spar web. Each panel is bay-contained.
- At spar-adjacent edges: a dedicated edge seal strip closes the gap between
  the panel edge and the spar web face.
- Edge seal material and compression: TBD sealant class (ATA 20 SHARED §6).

## 6. Interface References
