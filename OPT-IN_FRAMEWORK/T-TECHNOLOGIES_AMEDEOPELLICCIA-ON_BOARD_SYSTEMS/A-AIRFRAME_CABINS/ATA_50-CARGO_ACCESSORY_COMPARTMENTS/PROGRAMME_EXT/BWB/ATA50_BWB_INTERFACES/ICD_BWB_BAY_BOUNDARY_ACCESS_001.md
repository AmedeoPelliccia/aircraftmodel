# ICD-BWB-50-006 — Bay-to-Bay Access Provisions Through Spar Penetrations

**Delta:** DELTA-BWB-50-007
**Programme:** AMPEL360 BWB
**ATA:** 50 — Cargo & Accessory Compartments
**Baseline ref:** ATA50-SHARED §9
**LC Gate:** LC05
**Status:** TBD

## 1. Scope

This ICD defines BWB-only inter-bay access provisions through spar penetration
openings (manholes or access hatches) in the composite spar webs between adjacent
cargo bays. No WTW equivalent exists; this is a BWB-unique requirement driven by
the multi-bay flat-deck planform.

## 2. BWB Delta Statement

**ΔICD vs. SHARED:** SHARED baseline has no inter-bay spar penetration access
requirement. The BWB overlay introduces this as a new delta applicable only
to the BWB planform where cargo bays are separated by structural spars.

## 3. Penetration Opening Geometry

| Spar Boundary | Opening ID | Clear Width (mm) | Clear Height (mm) | Sill from Floor (mm) |
|---------------|-----------|-----------------|------------------|----------------------|
| SPAR-3 | ACCESS-S3 | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| SPAR-4 | ACCESS-S4 | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| SPAR-5 | ACCESS-S5 | TBD | TBD | TBD |

Minimum clear dimensions to be confirmed at LC05 based on maintenance access
ergonomics and structural analysis of spar web reduction.

## 4. Structural Reinforcement Requirements

- Opening perimeter: reinforcement doubler (CFRP or metallic) sized at LC05.
- Doubler extent: TBD mm beyond opening edge on both spar web faces.
- Fastener pattern for doubler: per ATA 20 SHARED fastener standard.
- Residual strength after opening: TBD % ultimate (LC05 FEA).

## 5. Closure and Sealing

- Opening closed by a hinged access hatch when not in use.
- Hatch material: TBD fire-rated material to match bay liner class.
- Seal at hatch perimeter: TBD intumescent + compression seal.
- Hatch latch: positive retention, tool-operated or quarter-turn type.
- Fire-stop compliance: hatch and seal must maintain bay fire containment
  classification when closed.

## 6. Maintenance and Operational Rules

- Access hatches may only be open during ground maintenance with cargo removed.
- Both adjacent bays must be empty when hatch is open.
- Hatch opening recorded in maintenance log per AMM procedure (TBD at LC06).

## 7. Interface References

- ATA 53: Composite spar web repair manual for penetration approval.
- ATA 26: Fire protection — hatch closure maintains fire-stop integrity.
- ATA50-SHARED §9: Baseline access provisions invoked by reference.
