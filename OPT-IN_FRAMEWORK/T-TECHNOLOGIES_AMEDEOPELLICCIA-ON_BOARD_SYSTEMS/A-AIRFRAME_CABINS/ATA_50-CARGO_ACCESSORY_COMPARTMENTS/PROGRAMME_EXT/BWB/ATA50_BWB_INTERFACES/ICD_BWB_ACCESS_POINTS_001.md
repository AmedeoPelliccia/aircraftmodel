# ICD-BWB-50-002 — Side-Access Cargo Door Geometry and Latch/Hinge (Per Bay)

**Delta:** DELTA-BWB-50-002
**Programme:** AMPEL360 BWB
**ATA:** 50 — Cargo & Accessory Compartments
**Baseline ref:** ATA50-SHARED §4
**LC Gate:** LC03
**Status:** TBD

## 1. Scope

This ICD defines the BWB-specific cargo access door geometry, latch/hinge
locations and operational requirements for each structural bay. Access is via
side-fuselage / wing lower-surface doors, not the upward-opening belly plug
door used on WTW.

## 2. BWB Delta Statement

**ΔICD vs. SHARED:** SHARED baseline defines generic access point requirements.
The BWB overlay redefines door orientation (side/lower-surface vs. WTW belly),
opening geometry (plug-type vs. WTW upward-plug), and hinge/latch positions
referenced to bay-specific structural frames.

## 3. Door Geometry (per bay)

| Bay | Door ID | Clear Opening W (mm) | Clear Opening H (mm) | Sill Height above Floor (mm) | Door Type |
|-----|---------|---------------------|---------------------|------------------------------|-----------|
| BAY-C1 | DOOR-BWB-C1 | TBD | TBD | TBD | Outward-plug, side lower |
| BAY-C2 | DOOR-BWB-C2 | TBD | TBD | TBD | Outward-plug, side lower |
| BAY-C3 | DOOR-BWB-C3 | TBD | TBD | TBD | Outward-plug, side lower |
| BAY-C4 | DOOR-BWB-C4 | TBD | TBD | TBD | Outward-plug, side lower |

Dimensions TBD at LC03 following wing-lower-surface geometry release.

## 4. Latch and Hinge Locations

- Hinge axis: parallel to spar direction (spanwise); located at door leading edge.
- Latch locations: TBD positions at door trailing edge, referenced to structural frames.
- Ground locking pin: TBD position (required when aircraft is on ground, gear extended).
- Over-centre latch geometry: TBD at LC04.

## 5. Operational Requirements

- Door must remain operable at static deflection up to TBD mm (LC05 load case).
- Door seal must maintain CS-25 pressurisation requirements.
- Cargo door warning circuit integration: see ATA 24 and ATA 31 interfaces.

## 6. Interface References

- ATA 52: Door frame structural interface — reinforcement doublers in composite skin.
- ATA 25 BWB: Emergency equipment access door not to be obscured.
- ATA50-SHARED §4: Baseline access point requirements invoked by reference.
