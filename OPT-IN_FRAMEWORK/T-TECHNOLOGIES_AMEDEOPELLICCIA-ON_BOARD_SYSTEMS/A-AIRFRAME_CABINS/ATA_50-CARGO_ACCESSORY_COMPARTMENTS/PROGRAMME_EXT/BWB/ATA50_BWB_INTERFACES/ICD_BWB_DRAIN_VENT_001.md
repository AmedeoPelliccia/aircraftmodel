# ICD-BWB-50-004 — Distributed Drain/Vent Routing via Spar Bay Penetrations

**Delta:** DELTA-BWB-50-004
**Programme:** AMPEL360 BWB
**ATA:** 50 — Cargo & Accessory Compartments
**Baseline ref:** ATA50-SHARED §6
**LC Gate:** LC04
**Status:** TBD

## 1. Scope

This ICD defines the BWB-specific drain and vent routing through dedicated spar
penetration fittings to the lower wing skin exit. Each structural bay has its own
drain collect point and drain mast.

## 2. BWB Delta Statement

**ΔICD vs. SHARED:** SHARED baseline defines generic drain/vent requirements.
The BWB overlay redefines routing as per-bay spar penetrations, replacing the
WTW continuous keel-line routing along the lower fuselage.

## 3. Per-Bay Drain Configuration

| Bay | Collect Point (FS/BL/WL) | Spar Penetration | Exit Drain Mast Location |
|-----|--------------------------|------------------|--------------------------|
| BAY-C1 | TBD | SPAR-3 web, location TBD | Lower skin station TBD |
| BAY-C2 | TBD | SPAR-4 web, location TBD | Lower skin station TBD |
| BAY-C3 | TBD | SPAR-5 web, location TBD | Lower skin station TBD |
| BAY-C4 | TBD | SPAR-6 web, location TBD | Lower skin station TBD |

All coordinates TBD at LC04 following wing structural layout release.

## 4. Spar Penetration Fitting Specification

- Fitting type: Grommet/doubler assembly bonded to spar web.
- Tube outer diameter: TBD mm.
- Sealant: TBD class per ATA 20 SHARED §6 (faying surface, wet installed).
- Fitting material: TBD corrosion-resistant alloy or CFRP compatible grade.
- Structural approval: spar web penetration requires Stress approval per LC04.

## 5. Drain Mast Interface

- Mast attachment to lower wing skin: TBD fastener pattern.
- Drain mast exit angle: TBD deg (aligned with local airflow, min drag).
- Anti-icing provision: TBD (electric or bleed per ATA 30).
- CS-25.1001 compliance: drain capacity per bay TBD L/min (LC04).

## 6. Vent Path

- Vent routing parallels drain routing; dedicated vent tube per bay.
- Vent exit: combined with drain mast or separate vent exit per structural
  team decision at LC04.

## 7. Interface References

- ATA 38: Water and waste drainage system interfaces.
- ATA 53: Spar web geometry and penetration approval.
- ATA50-SHARED §6: Baseline drain/vent requirements invoked by reference.
