# ICD-BWB-50-005 — Bay-Partitioned Fire Containment Liner Interfaces

**Delta:** DELTA-BWB-50-005
**Programme:** AMPEL360 BWB
**ATA:** 50 — Cargo & Accessory Compartments
**Baseline ref:** ATA50-SHARED §7
**LC Gate:** LC04
**Status:** TBD

## 1. Scope

This ICD defines the BWB-specific fire containment liner interface for the
bay-partitioned cargo compartments. Fire containment is partitioned per structural
bay using spar web fire-stops as bay boundaries per CS-25.855/856/857.

## 2. BWB Delta Statement

**ΔICD vs. SHARED:** SHARED baseline defines generic fire containment requirements.
The BWB overlay redefines fire containment as per-bay, using spar webs as
structural fire-stops between bays, replacing the WTW continuous belly-hold
fire liner that runs the full belly hold length.

## 3. Bay Fire-Containment Configuration

| Bay | Liner Class | Spar Fwd Fire-Stop | Spar Aft Fire-Stop | Panel Area (m²) |
|-----|-------------|-------------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| BAY-C1 | TBD (C or E) | SPAR-2 (integral) | SPAR-3 web | TBD |
| BAY-C2 | TBD (C or E) | SPAR-3 web | SPAR-4 web | TBD |
| BAY-C3 | TBD (C or E) | SPAR-4 web | SPAR-5 web | TBD |
| BAY-C4 | TBD (C or E) | SPAR-5 web | SPAR-6 web | TBD |

Fire liner class (C or E) confirmed at LC04 after smoke detector/suppression design.

## 4. Spar Web Fire-Stop Interface

- Spar web serves as the structural fire barrier between bays.
- Fire-stop sealing at spar-liner junction: TBD intumescent seal specification.
- Seal compression force: TBD N/m (LC04).
- Spar penetrations (drain tubes, wiring) through the fire-stop:
  each penetration sealed with approved fire-stop fitting.

## 5. Panel Specification

- Panel form: flat, bay-contained (no bay-boundary crossing, per BWB-50-000-003).
- Panel material: TBD fire-rated composite or metal panel to CS-25.856.
- Panel seam gap at spar-adjacent joints: ≤ TBD mm (fire containment limit, LC04).
- Attachment: per ICD-BWB-50-003 flat-rail scheme.
- Installation torque: per ATA 20 SHARED fastener standard.

## 6. Smoke Detection Integration

- Each bay has an independent smoke detector per BWB ATA 44 monitoring topology.
- Smoke detector wiring passes through spar fire-stop using approved through-fitting.
- See ATA 44 BWB `BWB-44-100-002` (bay-autonomous smoke detection).
