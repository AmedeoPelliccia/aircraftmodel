# ATA 50 BWB — Interfaces

This directory contains BWB-only Interface Control Documents (ICDs) for ATA 50
Cargo & Accessory Compartments. Each ICD documents a delta from the SHARED baseline.

No SHARED baseline interface content is reproduced here. Each ICD provides
only the BWB-specific delta from the corresponding SHARED clause.
