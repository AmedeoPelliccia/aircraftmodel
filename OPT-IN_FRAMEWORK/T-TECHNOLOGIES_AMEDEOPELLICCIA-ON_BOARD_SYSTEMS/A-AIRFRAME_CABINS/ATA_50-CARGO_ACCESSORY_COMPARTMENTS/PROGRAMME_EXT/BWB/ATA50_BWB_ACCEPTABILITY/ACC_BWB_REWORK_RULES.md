# ACC BWB — Rework Rules

**Programme:** AMPEL360 BWB
**ATA:** 50 — Cargo & Accessory Compartments
**Overlay:** PROGRAMME_EXT/BWB
**Status:** LC01 scaffold · procedures TBD (LC04–LC05)

## 1. Scope

This document defines rework rules for BWB-specific ATA 50 components.
All rework is subject to the standard practices defined in ATA 20 SHARED
and escalation rules defined in ATA 20 SHARED REPAIR_ACCEPTABILITY.md.

## 2. Flat-Panel Liner Rework

| Condition | Rework Action | ATA 20 SHARED Ref |
|-----------|--------------|-------------------|
| Edge chip ≤ allowable | Blend with fine abrasive; re-seal edge | REPAIR_ACCEPTABILITY §3 |
| Surface scratch (no penetration) | Clean; apply protective coating | STANDARDS_SURFACE_TREATMENTS §4 |
| Composite delamination ≤ allowable | Composite repair per ATA 20 SHARED NDT and repair procedure | REPAIR_ACCEPTABILITY §4 |
| Composite delamination > allowable | Replace panel | REPAIR_ACCEPTABILITY §5 |
| Panel-to-spar seam gap > limit | Re-seal with approved sealant; confirm compression | STANDARDS_SURFACE_TREATMENTS §6 |

### Escalation Trigger
Any panel damage with through-perforation, delamination larger than allowable,
or seam gap that cannot be corrected by re-sealing SHALL be referred to Engineering
for disposition. Engineering approval required before return to service.

## 3. Drain/Vent Fitting Rework

| Condition | Rework Action | ATA 20 SHARED Ref |
|-----------|--------------|-------------------|
| Sealant void at spar fitting | Remove fitting; re-apply approved sealant; reinstall | STANDARDS_SURFACE_TREATMENTS §6 |
| Drain tube ovality ≤ allowable | Monitor; inspect at next opportunity | INSPECTION_NDT §2 |
| Drain tube ovality > allowable | Replace tube and spar penetration fitting | REPAIR_ACCEPTABILITY §3 |

**Note:** Any rework of spar penetration fittings requires Stress written approval
per BWB-50-000-003 (spar integrity constraint).

## 4. Cargo Door Rework

| Condition | Rework Action | ATA 20 SHARED Ref |
|-----------|--------------|-------------------|
| Door skin dent ≤ allowable | Blend repair per door AMM | REPAIR_ACCEPTABILITY §3 |
| Seal damage | Replace seal; verify compression | STANDARDS_SURFACE_TREATMENTS §6 |
| Hinge pin wear > allowable | Replace pin; verify hinge alignment | REPAIR_ACCEPTABILITY §5 |
| Latch wear > allowable | Replace latch; functional test | REPAIR_ACCEPTABILITY §5 |

## 5. Fire-Stop / Bay Access Hatch Rework

All fire-stop seal damage SHALL be repaired before the aircraft is released
for flight. No cosmetic rework is permitted; fire-stop effectiveness must
be verified by inspection per INSPECTION_BWB_ACCESS_POINTS.md after rework.
