# ACC BWB — Spar Bay Clearances and Maintenance Access Limits

**Programme:** AMPEL360 BWB
**ATA:** 50 — Cargo & Accessory Compartments
**Overlay:** PROGRAMME_EXT/BWB
**Status:** LC01 scaffold · limits TBD (LC04–LC05)
**Note:** This document has no WTW equivalent. BWB-only delta.

## 1. Scope

This document defines BWB-specific clearance and maintenance access limits for
spar bay cargo compartments. The BWB planform requires specific clearances between
cargo items, structural components (spar webs, ribs), and maintenance access paths.

## 2. Spar Web Clearance Limits

| Interface | Minimum Clearance | Status |
|-----------|-------------------|--------|
| Cargo container edge to spar web face | TBD mm | TBD (LC03) |
| Liner panel edge to spar web face | TBD mm | TBD (LC04) |
| Drain tube to spar web penetration edge | TBD mm radial | TBD (LC04) |
| Restraint net attachment to spar web | TBD mm | TBD (LC05) |

## 3. Bay Access Hatch Clearance Limits

| Interface | Minimum Clearance | Status |
|-----------|-------------------|--------|
| Access hatch opening to cargo container | TBD mm | TBD (LC03) |
| Access hatch open swing radius (clear zone) | TBD mm | TBD (LC04) |
| Inter-bay access opening to structural doubler edge | TBD mm | TBD (LC05) |

## 4. Maintenance Personnel Access Requirements

- Minimum clear floor width for maintenance access within cargo bay: TBD mm (LC04).
- Minimum overhead clearance within bay during maintenance: TBD mm (LC04).
- Inter-bay hatch minimum opening for personnel crawl access: TBD mm × TBD mm (LC05).
- Access to drain fittings in floor must be possible without removing cargo liner panels.

## 5. Inspection Access Coverage

- All spar web faces within a bay must be visually accessible (or accessible
  by borescope) from the bay access door with cargo removed.
- Liner panel attachment rails must be inspectable from within the bay.
- Drain/vent fitting sealant must be inspectable without disassembly.

## 6. Ground Equipment Envelope

- Ground cargo loader/transfer equipment envelope at bay door: TBD (LC04).
- Loader platform engagement height: TBD mm above lower wing skin datum.
- Maximum loader lateral overhang within bay door: TBD mm.

## Notes

- All TBD dimensions locked at LC03–LC05 following structural layout release.
- Spar web clearances confirmed by Structures at LC03 PDR.
- Maintenance access ergonomics confirmed by Human Factors review at LC04.
