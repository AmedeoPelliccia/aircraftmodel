    This index lists only BWB-specific deltas. No SHARED baseline content
    is reproduced. Each delta references the affected baseline clause.
    The BWB planform integrates cargo compartments within the wing-box
    structure across multiple structural bays separated by spars.

deltas:
  - delta_id: DELTA-BWB-50-001
    title: Multi-bay flat-deck cargo compartment envelope
    type: ΔICD
    baseline_ref: ATA50-SHARED §3
    icd_file: ATA50_BWB_INTERFACES/ICD_BWB_COMPARTMENT_ENVELOPE_001.md
    lc_gate: LC03
    status: TBD
    note: >
      BWB cargo deck spans distributed bays. Envelope defined per-bay with
      spar limits, floor node coordinates, and net usable volume per bay.
      Differs from WTW circular belly-hold constraint.

  - delta_id: DELTA-BWB-50-002
    title: Side-access cargo door geometry and latch/hinge ICD (per bay)
    type: ΔICD
    baseline_ref: ATA50-SHARED §4
    icd_file: ATA50_BWB_INTERFACES/ICD_BWB_ACCESS_POINTS_001.md
    lc_gate: LC03
    status: TBD
    note: >
      BWB cargo access uses side-fuselage/wing-lower-surface doors per bay.
      Door clear-opening dimensions, hinge pin locations and latch mechanism
      differ from WTW upward-opening belly plug door configuration.

  - delta_id: DELTA-BWB-50-003
    title: Flat-panel liner attachment scheme (spar-boundary aware)
    type: ΔICD
    baseline_ref: ATA50-SHARED §5
    icd_file: ATA50_BWB_INTERFACES/ICD_BWB_LINER_ATTACHMENTS_001.md
    lc_gate: LC04
    status: TBD
    note: >
      Liner panels are flat (not curved). Attachment rails run parallel to
      spar lines. No panel SHALL span a spar bay boundary; each panel is
      self-contained within one bay.

  - delta_id: DELTA-BWB-50-004
    title: Distributed drain/vent routing via spar bay penetrations
    type: ΔICD
    baseline_ref: ATA50-SHARED §6
    icd_file: ATA50_BWB_INTERFACES/ICD_BWB_DRAIN_VENT_001.md
    lc_gate: LC04
    status: TBD
    note: >
      Drain and vent paths route through dedicated spar penetration fittings
      to the lower wing skin exit. Each bay has its own drain collect point.
      Differs from WTW keel-line routing.

  - delta_id: DELTA-BWB-50-005
    title: Bay-partitioned fire containment liner interfaces
    type: ΔICD
    baseline_ref: ATA50-SHARED §7
    icd_file: ATA50_BWB_INTERFACES/ICD_BWB_FIRE_CONTAINMENT_IF_001.md
    lc_gate: LC04
    status: TBD
    note: >
      Fire containment liner is partitioned per structural bay. Spar web
      fire-stops serve as the bay boundary. Panel seam gap at spar-adjacent
      joints defines the fire containment class.

  - delta_id: DELTA-BWB-50-006
    title: Cargo net/restraint attach interfaces at spar bay frames
    type: ΔREQ+ΔICD
    baseline_ref: ATA50-SHARED §8
    lc_gate: LC05
    status: TBD
    note: >
      Restraint attach fittings are located on spar frames and floor nodes.
      Load introduction into composite spar web requires dedicated metallic
      inserts; defined at LC05 after FEA.

  - delta_id: DELTA-BWB-50-007
    title: Bay-to-bay access provisions through spar penetrations
    type: ΔREQ+ΔICD
    baseline_ref: ATA50-SHARED §9
    icd_file: ATA50_BWB_INTERFACES/ICD_BWB_BAY_BOUNDARY_ACCESS_001.md
    lc_gate: LC05
    status: TBD
    note: >
      Access between adjacent cargo bays requires spar penetration openings
      (manholes or hatches). Opening geometry, reinforcement and sealing are
      BWB-only requirements not present in WTW.
