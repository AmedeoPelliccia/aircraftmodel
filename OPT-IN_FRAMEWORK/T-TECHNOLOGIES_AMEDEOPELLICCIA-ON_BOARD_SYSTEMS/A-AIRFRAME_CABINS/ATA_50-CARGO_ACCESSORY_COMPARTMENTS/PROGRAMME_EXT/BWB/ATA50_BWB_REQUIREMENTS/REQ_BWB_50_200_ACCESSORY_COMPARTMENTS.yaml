# AMPEL360 BWB — ATA 50-200 Accessory Compartment Requirements (BWB-only deltas)

requirements:
  ata_subchapter: "50-200"
  programme: AMPEL360-BWB
  overlay: PROGRAMME_EXT/BWB

  reqs:
    - req_id: BWB-50-200-001
      shall: >
        Accessory compartments integrated within the BWB wing-box structure
        SHALL be accessible without entry into a cargo bay that is loaded or
        sealed for flight.
      rationale: >
        BWB planform places accessory systems in close proximity to cargo bays
        due to the distributed architecture. Maintenance access routes must
        not require displacement of cargo.

    - req_id: BWB-50-200-002
      shall: >
        Drain provisions for accessory compartments within the wing-box SHALL
        route to the same per-bay spar penetration drain fitting as the cargo
        bay drain per ICD-BWB-50-004.
      rationale: >
        Minimises spar web penetrations by sharing drain routing infrastructure
        between cargo and accessory compartments within the same bay.

    - req_id: BWB-50-200-003
      shall: >
        Ventilation of accessory compartments SHALL be provided via the
        per-bay vent path defined in ICD-BWB-50-004, maintaining required
        air change rates per CS-25.1103.
      rationale: >
        Accessory compartment ventilation in BWB planform integrates with the
        per-bay distributed vent infrastructure to avoid additional spar
        penetrations.
