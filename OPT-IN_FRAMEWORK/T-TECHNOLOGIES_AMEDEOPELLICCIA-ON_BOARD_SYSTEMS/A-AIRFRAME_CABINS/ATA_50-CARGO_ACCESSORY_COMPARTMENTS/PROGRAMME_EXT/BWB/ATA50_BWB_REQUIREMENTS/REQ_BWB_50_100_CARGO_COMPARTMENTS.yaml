# AMPEL360 BWB — ATA 50-100 Cargo Compartment Requirements (BWB-only deltas)

requirements:
  ata_subchapter: "50-100"
  programme: AMPEL360-BWB
  overlay: PROGRAMME_EXT/BWB

  reqs:
    - req_id: BWB-50-100-001
      shall: >
        Each cargo bay fire containment liner SHALL be classified to CS-25.855
        Class C or Class E. The required class for each bay SHALL be defined by
        the fire protection analysis at LC04.
      rationale: >
        Bay-partitioned compartments require individual fire classification.
        The spar web fire-stop provides the bay boundary; liner class determines
        suppression system requirements.

    - req_id: BWB-50-100-002
      shall: >
        Cargo bay liner panels SHALL comply with CS-25.856 and SHALL be
        flat panels (not curved), each confined to a single structural bay
        per BWB-50-000-003.
      rationale: >
        The BWB flat-deck planform has flat floor/ceiling surfaces. Using
        flat panels simplifies manufacturing and inspection while meeting
        CS-25.856 liner requirements.

    - req_id: BWB-50-100-003
      shall: >
        Cargo compartment fire protection (suppression agent distribution)
        SHALL be partitioned by bay per CS-25.857. Agent SHALL not be
        required to cross a spar web boundary to protect an adjacent bay.
      rationale: >
        Bay-partitioned fire containment means suppression must be independently
        effective within each bay without relying on agent migrating across
        the structural spar fire-stop.

    - req_id: BWB-50-100-004
      shall: >
        Cargo floor/restraint structure in each bay SHALL withstand the load
        cases defined in CS-25.561, applied independently per bay, with
        metallic inserts at spar frame floor nodes per BWB-50-000-004.
      rationale: >
        Each bay must independently meet restraint requirements because
        the BWB planform does not have a continuous floor structure transferring
        loads between bays.

    - req_id: BWB-50-100-005
      shall: >
        Spar web fire-stop sealing at spar penetrations (drain tubes, wiring,
        access hatch perimeters) SHALL maintain the fire containment
        classification of both adjacent bays.
      rationale: >
        Any penetration of the spar web fire-stop is a potential failure mode
        for bay fire containment. All penetrations must be sealed with approved
        fire-stop fittings.
