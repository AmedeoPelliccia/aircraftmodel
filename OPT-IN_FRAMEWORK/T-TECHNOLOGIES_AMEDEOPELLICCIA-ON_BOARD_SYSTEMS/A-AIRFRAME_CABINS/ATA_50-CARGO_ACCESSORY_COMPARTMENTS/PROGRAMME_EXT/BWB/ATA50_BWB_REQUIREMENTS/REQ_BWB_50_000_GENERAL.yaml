# AMPEL360 BWB — ATA 50 General Requirements (BWB-only deltas)

requirements:
  ata_subchapter: "50-000"
  programme: AMPEL360-BWB
  overlay: PROGRAMME_EXT/BWB

  reqs:
    - req_id: BWB-50-000-001
      shall: >
        The BWB cargo compartment total usable volume across all structural bays
        SHALL meet the design payload requirement defined in the aircraft
        performance specification.
      rationale: >
        BWB distributed multi-bay architecture must achieve equivalent cargo
        volume to justify payload capability vs. WTW.

    - req_id: BWB-50-000-002
      shall: >
        Each structural bay SHALL have an independent cargo compartment
        envelope definition referenced to spar-bounded coordinates, as defined
        in ICD-BWB-50-001.
      rationale: >
        Per-bay envelope definition is required because the BWB planform
        geometry varies between bays. A single envelope definition is not
        adequate.

    - req_id: BWB-50-000-003
      shall: >
        No single cargo container, liner panel, or restraint net SHALL bridge
        more than one structural bay boundary (spar web). Each item SHALL be
        fully contained within a single bay.
      rationale: >
        Spar bay integrity for fire containment, structural load distribution
        and maintenance access requires that no element spans a spar boundary.
        This is the fundamental BWB planform constraint for ATA 50.

    - req_id: BWB-50-000-004
      shall: >
        Cargo restraint net attach fittings SHALL be located at spar frame
        floor nodes within each bay. Load introduction into composite spar
        web SHALL use metallic inserts approved by Stress at LC05.
      rationale: >
        Composite spar webs require metallic inserts for concentrated load
        introduction. Direct attachment to bare CFRP web is not permitted.

    - req_id: BWB-50-000-005
      shall: >
        Emergency equipment access to each cargo bay SHALL be possible through
        the bay access door without requiring tools or the removal of cargo
        items per CS-25.1411.
      rationale: >
        Emergency access must be maintained in each bay independently, as
        the BWB configuration does not have a continuous cargo hold corridor.
