# AMPEL360 BWB — ATA 50-300 Cargo Door Requirements (BWB-only deltas)

requirements:
  ata_subchapter: "50-300"
  programme: AMPEL360-BWB
  overlay: PROGRAMME_EXT/BWB

  reqs:
    - req_id: BWB-50-300-001
      shall: >
        Each cargo bay SHALL have a dedicated side-access (wing lower surface)
        cargo door per ICD-BWB-50-002. The door SHALL open outward (plug-type)
        and SHALL NOT open toward the ground or inward.
      rationale: >
        BWB side-access configuration requires outward-plug doors. The
        WTW upward-opening belly plug configuration is not applicable.

    - req_id: BWB-50-300-002
      shall: >
        Cargo door clear opening dimensions per bay SHALL meet the minimum
        requirements for loading/unloading standard unit load devices (ULDs)
        intended for that bay. Minimum dimensions are TBD at LC03.
      rationale: >
        Door opening must accommodate the cargo unit type planned for each bay
        without damage to the unit or aircraft structure.

    - req_id: BWB-50-300-003
      shall: >
        Cargo door latch mechanism SHALL provide a ground-locking pin position
        operable from outside the aircraft. The pin SHALL prevent inadvertent
        door opening during ground loading operations.
      rationale: >
        Safety requirement for ground operations. BWB side-access door
        configuration requires an external locking provision accessible to
        ground crew.

    - req_id: BWB-50-300-004
      shall: >
        Each cargo door SHALL be integrated with the aircraft door warning
        system. An open-door indication SHALL be provided on the flight deck
        and at ground crew station per aircraft system architecture.
      rationale: >
        Per CS-25.783, door-open warnings are required for all cargo doors.
        BWB multi-bay configuration requires per-door warning signals.
