# AMPEL360 BWB — ATA 50-400 Drainage & Venting Requirements (BWB-only deltas)

requirements:
  ata_subchapter: "50-400"
  programme: AMPEL360-BWB
  overlay: PROGRAMME_EXT/BWB

  reqs:
    - req_id: BWB-50-400-001
      shall: >
        Each structural cargo bay SHALL have an independent drain collect
        point at the lowest point of the bay floor, routing through a
        dedicated spar penetration fitting to a lower wing skin drain mast
        per ICD-BWB-50-004.
      rationale: >
        Distributed bay architecture requires per-bay drain provisions.
        A single keel-line drain (WTW) is not applicable; each bay must
        drain independently to prevent water accumulation at spar boundaries.

    - req_id: BWB-50-400-002
      shall: >
        Drain capacity per bay SHALL meet TBD L/min as defined by CS-25.1001.
        Drain capacity confirmed at LC04 after aircraft system sizing.
      rationale: >
        Per-bay drain must have sufficient capacity to clear maximum expected
        water ingress rate from door seals, condensation and spillage.

    - req_id: BWB-50-400-003
      shall: >
        Spar penetration drain fittings SHALL be sealed with an approved
        sealant per ATA 20 SHARED §6 (wet-installed faying surface) to
        prevent pressurisation leakage at the fitting interface.
      rationale: >
        Spar penetrations are structural boundaries in a pressurised section.
        Sealant class must match the pressurisation differential and service
        life requirements.

    - req_id: BWB-50-400-004
      shall: >
        Ventilation of each cargo bay SHALL be provided via a per-bay vent
        path maintaining air change rate per CS-25.1103. Vent routing SHALL
        be routed through the spar penetration fitting per ICD-BWB-50-004
        or via a dedicated vent path approved at LC04.
      rationale: >
        Bay-partitioned compartments require independent ventilation paths.
        The vent path design avoids cross-bay contamination in a fire scenario.
