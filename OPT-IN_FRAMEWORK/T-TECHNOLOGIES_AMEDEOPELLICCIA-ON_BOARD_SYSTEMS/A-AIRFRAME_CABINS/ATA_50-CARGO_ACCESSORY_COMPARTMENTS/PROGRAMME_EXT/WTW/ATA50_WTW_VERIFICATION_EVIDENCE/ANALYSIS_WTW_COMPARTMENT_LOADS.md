# ANALYSIS — WTW Cargo Compartment Loads (CS-25.365)

**Evidence ID:** EV-WTW-50-001  
**Type:** Analysis  
**Programme:** AMPEL360 WTW  
**Regulation:** CS-25.365 Pressurised compartment loads  
**Delta:** DELTA-WTW-50-001  
**Status:** STUB — LC01. Full analysis gate LC04.

## 1. Objective

Demonstrate that the WTW forward and aft belly-hold compartment structure sustains
pressurisation loads per CS-25.365, using the circular fuselage cross-section
envelope defined in ICD-WTW-50-001.

---

## 2. Method (Planned)

- FEA of pressure vessel with belly-hold cutout at FWD/AFT door frames
- Load case: maximum differential pressure × safety factor per CS-25.365
- Evaluate frame, stringer and keel beam at cargo cutout

---

## 3. Acceptance Criteria

- Margin of Safety ≥ 0.0 at ultimate load at all primary structural members
- No permanent deformation at limit load
