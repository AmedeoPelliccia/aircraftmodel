# TEST — WTW Fire Containment Liner (CS-25.855/856/857)

**Evidence ID:** EV-WTW-50-003  
**Type:** Test  
**Programme:** AMPEL360 WTW  
**Regulation:** CS-25.855 / CS-25.856 / CS-25.857  
**Delta:** DELTA-WTW-50-005  
**Status:** STUB — LC01. Test planning gate LC04.

## 1. Objective

Demonstrate that WTW belly-hold fire containment liner panels satisfy
CS-25.855 (liner penetration limits), CS-25.856 (liner material flammability),
and CS-25.857 (cargo compartment classification).

---

## 2. Test Scope (Planned)

- **Material flammability test** per CS-25.856 on curved liner panel specimen
- **Fire exposure test** per CS-25.855 — burner test with curved panel on representative curved rail attachment
- Verify seam gap remains within ICD-WTW-50-005 limit during 60-min exposure
- **Classification confirmation** per CS-25.857 Class C or E

---

## 3. Acceptance Criteria

- No flame penetration beyond panel seam during CS-25.855 test duration
- Material meets CS-25.856 flammability requirement
- Compartment meets CS-25.857 classification requirement
