      title: Circular fuselage belly-hold envelope constraints
      author: TBD
      date: TBD
      lc_gate: LC01
      status: OPEN
      description: >
        Introduces WTW-specific cargo compartment envelope definition based on
        circular fuselage cross-section geometry. Belly-hold width, height and
        length constraints differ from BWB flat-floor planform.

    - change_id: CHG-0002
      delta_id: DELTA-WTW-50-002
      title: Cargo access door geometry and latch/hinge ICD
      author: TBD
      date: TBD
      lc_gate: LC01
      status: OPEN
      description: >
        Defines WTW belly cargo door clear-opening dimensions, sill height above
        ground line, hinge pin locations, and latch mechanism ICD.
        Differs from BWB side-access configuration.

    - change_id: CHG-0003
      delta_id: DELTA-WTW-50-003
      title: Liner attachment rail/clip pattern (circular cross-section)
      author: TBD
      date: TBD
      lc_gate: LC01
      status: OPEN
      description: >
        Liner attachment rail locations follow the curved fuselage skin frame
        pitch. Clip type and spacing differ from BWB flat-panel attach scheme.

    - change_id: CHG-0004
      delta_id: DELTA-WTW-50-004
      title: Drain and vent path routing in lower fuselage skin
      author: TBD
      date: TBD
      lc_gate: LC01
      status: OPEN
      description: >
        Drain mast and vent port routing runs along lowest keel of circular
        fuselage cross-section. ΔICD defines penetration coordinates, fitting
        type and sealing specification.

      delta_id: DELTA-WTW-50-005
      title: Fire containment liner interfaces (CS-25.855/856)
      author: TBD
      date: TBD
      lc_gate: LC01
      status: OPEN
      description: >
        Fire-containment liner panel specification for WTW belly hold per
        CS-25.855/856. Panel area, attachment torque and sealant class defined
        at LC04.

    - change_id: CHG-0006
      delta_id: DELTA-WTW-50-006
      title: Belly-hold net/restraint attach interfaces
      author: TBD
      date: TBD
      lc_gate: LC01
      status: OPEN
      description: >
        Cargo net attachment fitting locations in forward and aft belly holds.
        Load introduction into fuselage frames defined at LC05.
