# AMPEL360 WTW — ATA 50-300 Cargo Access Doors (WTW delta)
programme: AMPEL360-WTW
ata_subchapter: "50-300"
title: Cargo Access Doors
baseline_ref: ATA50-SHARED §5

requirements:
  - req_id: WTW-50-300-001
    shall: >
      WTW forward and aft cargo doors shall provide a clear opening not less than
      the dimensions defined in ICD-WTW-50-002. Door actuation shall be
      electro-hydraulic per ATA 29 power reference.
    rationale: >
      Clear opening drives container/pallet compatibility and ground handling
      equipment interface. WTW dimensions are constrained by circular fuselage.
    cs25_ref: CS-25.783
    delta_ref: DELTA-WTW-50-002
    verification: Inspection (dimensional)
    lc_gate: LC03

  - req_id: WTW-50-300-002
    shall: >
      WTW cargo door latching system shall provide positive closure indication
      and shall meet the structural requirements of CS-25.783 at the hinge and
      latch load limits per ICD-WTW-50-002.
    rationale: >
      Cargo door latch structural integrity is a certification requirement;
      WTW-specific latch load limits must be derived from fuselage frame sizing.
    cs25_ref: CS-25.783
    delta_ref: DELTA-WTW-50-002
    verification: Analysis (loads) + Test (proof load)
    lc_gate: LC04

  - req_id: WTW-50-300-003
    shall: >
      A ground locking pin shall be installed on each WTW cargo door sill
      fitting to prevent unintended closure during ground loading operations.
      Pin interface per ICD-WTW-50-002.
    rationale: >
      Ground operations safety; WTW upward-opening plug door requires positive
      locking during loading to prevent injury.
