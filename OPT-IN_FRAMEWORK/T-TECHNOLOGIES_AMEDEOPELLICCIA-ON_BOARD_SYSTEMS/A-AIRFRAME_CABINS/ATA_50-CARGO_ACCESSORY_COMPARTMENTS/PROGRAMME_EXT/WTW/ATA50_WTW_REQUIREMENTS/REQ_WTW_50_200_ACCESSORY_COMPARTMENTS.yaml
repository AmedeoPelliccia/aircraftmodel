# AMPEL360 WTW — ATA 50-200 Accessory Compartments (WTW delta)
programme: AMPEL360-WTW
ata_subchapter: "50-200"
title: Accessory Compartments
baseline_ref: ATA50-SHARED §4

requirements:
  - req_id: WTW-50-200-001
    shall: >
      WTW accessory compartments (E/E bay, avionics, optional crew rest) shall
      be located within the fuselage according to the WTW zone definition. Each
      compartment envelope shall respect the circular fuselage cross-section
      constraints per ICD-WTW-50-001.
    rationale: >
      Accessory compartment placement is WTW-specific; the circular cross-section
      limits lateral extent differently from BWB.
    cs25_ref: CS-25.831
    delta_ref: DELTA-WTW-50-001
    verification: Inspection (dimensional)
    lc_gate: LC03

  - req_id: WTW-50-200-002
    shall: >
      Drainage from WTW accessory compartments shall be routed to drain mast
      penetrations per ICD-WTW-50-004. No drain path shall breach a Class C
      cargo compartment liner boundary without a qualified penetration fitting.
    rationale: >
      Cross-compartment drain routing is a certification compliance issue;
      WTW routing differs from BWB due to belly-hold geometry.

  - req_id: WTW-50-200-003
    shall: >
      Ventilation of WTW accessory compartments shall be provided per CS-25.1103
      using vent ports defined in ICD-WTW-50-004. Vent flow rate shall be TBD
      (LC04) l/min minimum.
    rationale: >
      Ventilation is mandated for occupied and equipment compartments; WTW
      vent port locations are driven by the circular fuselage geometry.
