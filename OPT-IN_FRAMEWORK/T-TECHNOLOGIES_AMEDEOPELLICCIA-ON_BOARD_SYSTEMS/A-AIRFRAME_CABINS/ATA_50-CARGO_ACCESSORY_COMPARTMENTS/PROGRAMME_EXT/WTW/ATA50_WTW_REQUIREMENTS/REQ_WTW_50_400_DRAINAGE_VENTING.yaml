# REQ_WTW_50_400_DRAINAGE_VENTING.yaml
# AMPEL360 WTW — ATA 50-400 Drainage & Venting (WTW delta)
programme: AMPEL360-WTW
ata_subchapter: "50-400"
title: Drainage & Venting
baseline_ref: ATA50-SHARED §6

requirements:
  - req_id: WTW-50-400-001
    shall: >
      WTW belly-hold drain mast penetrations shall be located at the keel of
      the circular fuselage at the stations defined in ICD-WTW-50-004. No fluid
      accumulation shall exceed TBD ml (LC04) in any hold.
    rationale: >
      Keel positioning of drain masts is driven by circular fuselage geometry;
      fluid accumulation limit is a fire risk and contamination control
      requirement.
    cs25_ref: CS-25.1001
    delta_ref: DELTA-WTW-50-004
    verification: Inspection + Test (drainage flow)
    lc_gate: LC04

  - req_id: WTW-50-400-002
    shall: >
      Drain mast penetrations through the fuselage skin shall be sealed with
      Class B sealant per ATA 20 standard and shall maintain seal integrity
      under pressurisation cycling for the WTW design life.
    rationale: >
      Penetration sealing is critical for pressure vessel integrity; Class B
      sealant is the ATA 20 standard for structural skin penetrations.
    cs25_ref: CS-25.571
    delta_ref: DELTA-WTW-50-004
    verification: Inspection + Pressure test
    lc_gate: LC04

  - req_id: WTW-50-400-003
    shall: >
      WTW cargo compartment vent port flow rate shall not be less than TBD l/min
      (LC04) per CS-25.1103 to prevent accumulation of flammable vapours.
    rationale: >
      Ventilation adequacy for fire safety; WTW vent port area is constrained
      by fuselage skin geometry and pressurisation requirements.
