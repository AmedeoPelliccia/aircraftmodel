# AMPEL360 WTW — ATA 50 General requirements (WTW delta)
programme: AMPEL360-WTW
ata_subchapter: "50-000"
title: General
baseline_ref: ATA50-SHARED §2

requirements:
  - req_id: WTW-50-000-001
    shall: >
      The WTW cargo compartment envelope shall conform to the circular fuselage
      inner mould line as defined in ICD-WTW-50-001, with usable floor width
      and height as established at LC03.
    rationale: >
      WTW uses a circular fuselage; available cargo envelope is constrained by
      the curvature of the pressure vessel, unlike BWB flat-floor planform.
    cs25_ref: CS-25.365
    delta_ref: DELTA-WTW-50-001
    verification: Analysis (loads) + Inspection (dimensional)
    lc_gate: LC03

  - req_id: WTW-50-000-002
    shall: >
      All WTW cargo compartment liner panels shall be curved to match the
      fuselage inner mould line radius within the tolerance defined in
      ICD-WTW-50-003.
    rationale: >
      Flat panels specified in SHARED baseline are not applicable to the
      circular WTW cross-section; gaps at liner seams must remain within fire
      containment limits.
    cs25_ref: CS-25.855
    delta_ref: DELTA-WTW-50-003
    verification: Inspection
    lc_gate: LC04

  - req_id: WTW-50-000-003
    shall: >
      Cargo net/restraint attach fittings shall be designed to introduce loads
      into fuselage floor frames per CS-25.787 and CS-25.561, with load limits
      defined at LC05.
    rationale: >
      WTW cargo floor structure uses keel beam and lower frame attachments;
      load introduction points are WTW-specific.
    cs25_ref: CS-25.787
    delta_ref: DELTA-WTW-50-006
    verification: Analysis (FEA)
    lc_gate: LC05

  - req_id: WTW-50-000-004
    shall: >
      Retention of items of mass in the WTW cargo holds shall meet CS-25.789
      under all load conditions defined in the WTW loads envelope.
    rationale: >
      Load factors per WTW structural sizing; values differ from BWB mass
      cases due to different CG envelope and manoeuvre loads.
    cs25_ref: CS-25.789
    delta_ref: DELTA-WTW-50-006
    verification: Analysis
    lc_gate: LC05

  - req_id: WTW-50-000-005
    shall: >
      Access to required safety equipment in cargo compartments shall be
      maintained per CS-25.1411 with clear-opening dimensions per ICD-WTW-50-002.
    rationale: >
      Cargo door clear opening constrains accessibility; WTW opening dimensions
      must be verified against CS-25.1411 ergonomic requirements.
