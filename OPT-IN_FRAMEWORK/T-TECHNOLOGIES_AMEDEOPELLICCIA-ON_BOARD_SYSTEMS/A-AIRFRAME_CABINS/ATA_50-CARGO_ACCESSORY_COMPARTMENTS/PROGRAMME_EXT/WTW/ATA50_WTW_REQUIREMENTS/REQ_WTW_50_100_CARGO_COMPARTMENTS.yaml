# AMPEL360 WTW — ATA 50-100 Cargo Compartments (WTW delta)
programme: AMPEL360-WTW
ata_subchapter: "50-100"
title: Cargo Compartments
baseline_ref: ATA50-SHARED §3

requirements:
  - req_id: WTW-50-100-001
    shall: >
      WTW forward and aft belly holds shall be classified to CS-25.857 Class C
      or Class E as confirmed at LC04. Fire-containment liner panels shall
      satisfy CS-25.855 area and seam gap limits per ICD-WTW-50-005.
    rationale: >
      CS-25.855/856/857 compliance is mandatory for belly holds; classification
      drives liner material, suppression system and monitoring requirements.
    cs25_ref: CS-25.855
    delta_ref: DELTA-WTW-50-005
    verification: Test (fire liner certification) + Inspection
    lc_gate: LC04

  - req_id: WTW-50-100-002
    shall: >
      Fire containment liner panels in WTW belly holds shall comply with
      CS-25.856 material flammability standard. Panel attachment shall maintain
      full seating on curved rail under 60-min fire exposure.
    rationale: >
      WTW curved liner panel attachment differs from SHARED flat-panel baseline;
      the curved rail-clip system must be validated for fire resistance.
    cs25_ref: CS-25.856
    delta_ref: DELTA-WTW-50-005
    verification: Test
    lc_gate: LC04

  - req_id: WTW-50-100-003
    shall: >
      Fire detection and suppression system interfaces in WTW belly holds shall
      be routed per ATA 26 overlay requirements without breach of fire
      containment liner per CS-25.857.
    rationale: >
      System penetrations through fire-containment liner are a certification
      finding risk. WTW-specific routing must be validated.

    verification: Inspection + Analysis
    lc_gate: LC04

  - req_id: WTW-50-100-004
    shall: >
      Cargo restraint fittings on WTW cargo floor shall meet the load limits
      defined in the WTW cargo floor structural analysis per CS-25.561 load
      factors.
    rationale: >
      Load introduction into the circular fuselage keel differs from BWB;
      fitting design must match WTW-specific load paths.
