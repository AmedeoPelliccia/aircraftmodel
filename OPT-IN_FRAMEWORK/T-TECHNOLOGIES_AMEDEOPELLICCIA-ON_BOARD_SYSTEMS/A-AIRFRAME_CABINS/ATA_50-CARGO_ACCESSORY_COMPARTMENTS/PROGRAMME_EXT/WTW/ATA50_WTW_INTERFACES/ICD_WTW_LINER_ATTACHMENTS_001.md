# ICD-WTW-50-003 — Liner Attachment Rail/Clip Pattern (Circular Cross-Section)

**Delta:** DELTA-WTW-50-003  
**Programme:** AMPEL360 WTW  
**ATA:** 50-10 Cargo Compartments  
**Status:** TBD — thresholds gate LC04  
**Interfaces with:** ATA 53 fuselage frames, ATA 20 fastener standard

## 1. Purpose

Defines the WTW liner attachment rail and clip pattern adapted for the curved
inner surface of a circular fuselage cross-section.

## 2. Attachment Rail Layout

| Parameter | FWD Hold | AFT Hold | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Rail type | Curved aluminium extrusion | Curved aluminium extrusion | Radius matches fuselage IML |
| Rail pitch (frame spacing, mm) | TBD (LC04) | TBD (LC04) | Follows ATA 53 frame pitch |
| Clip type | Spring-loaded stud | Spring-loaded stud | Per ATA 20 standard |
| Clip torque (N·m) | TBD (LC04) | TBD (LC04) | Ref ATA 20 fastener table |
| Panel overlap (mm) | TBD (LC04) | TBD (LC04) | Lateral seam closure |

## 3. Panel Curvature Requirement

> Liner panels shall match the fuselage inner mould line radius within ± TBD mm
> (LC04) to achieve full seating on the attachment rail clips.  
> Flat-panel specification from SHARED baseline is **not applicable** to WTW.

---

## 4. WTW Delta Statement

> **ΔICD vs. SHARED baseline §5:**  
> SHARED baseline specifies flat-panel liner attachment for BWB flat-floor
> bays. WTW uses curved panel/rail system; rail bending radius and panel forming
> tolerance are WTW-only constraints.
