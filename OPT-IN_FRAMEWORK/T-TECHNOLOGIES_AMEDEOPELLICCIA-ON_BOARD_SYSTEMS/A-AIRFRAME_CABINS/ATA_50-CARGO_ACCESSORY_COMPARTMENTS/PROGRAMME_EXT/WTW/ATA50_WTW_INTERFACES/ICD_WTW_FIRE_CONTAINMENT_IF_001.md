# ICD-WTW-50-005 — Fire Containment Liner Interfaces (CS-25.855/856)

**Delta:** DELTA-WTW-50-005  
**Programme:** AMPEL360 WTW  
**ATA:** 50-10 Cargo Compartments / ATA 26 Fire Protection  
**Status:** TBD — thresholds gate LC04  
**Interfaces with:** ATA 26 fire protection systems, ATA 20 sealant standard

## 1. Purpose

Defines the WTW-specific fire-containment liner panel specification, attachment
interface and sealant class for belly-hold cargo compartments per CS-25.855/856.

---

## 2. Fire Liner Classification

| Compartment | CS-25.857 class | Liner material | Standard ref |
|---|---|---|---|
| FWD belly hold | Class C (TBC at LC04) | Fibre-reinforced thermoset | TBD |
| AFT belly hold | Class C (TBC at LC04) | Fibre-reinforced thermoset | TBD |

## 3. Panel Attachment Interface

| Parameter | Value | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Panel area (max, m²) | TBD (LC04) | Fire certification panel size limit |
| Attachment fastener | TBD | Per ATA 20 fastener standard |
| Fastener torque (N·m) | TBD (LC04) | Dry / wet-sealant states |
| Seam sealant class | TBD (LC04) | Per ATA 20 sealant table |
| Gap at panel edge (max, mm) | TBD (LC04) | CS-25.855 penetration limit |

## 4. WTW Delta Statement

> **ΔICD vs. SHARED baseline §7:**  
> WTW belly-hold curved panel geometry requires curved fire-liner panels with
> specific attachment torque for curved rail. SHARED baseline fire liner ICD
> applies to flat panels (BWB). WTW panel area and seam overlap requirements
> are WTW-specific.
