requirements:
  - req_id: WTW-25-500-001
    title: "Cargo liner attachment — WTW lower lobe frame/stringer"
    shall: >
      Cargo compartment liner panels shall be attached to WTW lower-lobe frames
      and stringers per approved attachment scheme (attachment PN and spacing TBD at LC03).
      Liner attachment shall not penetrate pressure vessel skin without an approved
      sealed fastener scheme.
    rationale: "WTW circular fuselage lower lobe liner attachment is frame/stringer based, unlike BWB distributed floor panels."
    verification: Dimensional inspection + assembly compliance check
    lc_gate: LC03

  - req_id: WTW-25-500-002
    title: "Cargo liner flammability"
    shall: >
      All cargo compartment liner materials shall meet CS-25.853 class C (or as specified
      in Type Design for WTW). Material qualification records shall be registered in
      TEST_WTW_FLAMMABILITY_25_853.md.
    rationale: "WTW may use different liner materials than BWB; variant-specific tracking required."
    verification: Test per CS-25.853 Appendix F
    cs25_ref: "CS-25.853"
    lc_gate: LC06

  - req_id: WTW-25-500-003
    title: "Cargo door liner clearance — WTW"
    shall: >
      Cargo liner panels shall maintain minimum TBD mm clearance to cargo door hinge
      and latch mechanism throughout full door travel (ATA 52 interface).
    rationale: "WTW aft lower lobe cargo door geometry is variant-specific."
    verification: Dimensional inspection with door cycled
    lc_gate: LC03
