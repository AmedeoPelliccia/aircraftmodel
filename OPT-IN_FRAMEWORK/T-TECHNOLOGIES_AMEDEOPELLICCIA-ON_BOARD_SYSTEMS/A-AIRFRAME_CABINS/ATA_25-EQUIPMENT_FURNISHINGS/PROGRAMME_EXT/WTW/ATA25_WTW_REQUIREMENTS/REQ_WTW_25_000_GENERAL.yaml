  - req_id: WTW-25-000-001
    title: "Overlay non-duplication"
    shall: >
      WTW-specific ATA 25 content shall supplement, not duplicate, SHARED baseline
      content in the ATA_25 root. Where WTW-specific thresholds differ from SHARED,
      the WTW threshold governs for AMPEL360 WTW.
    rationale: "Prevents configuration drift between SHARED and variant-specific content."
    verification: Configuration audit (CM)

      regulations (as listed in ATA25_WTW_COMPLIANCE_MATRIX.md) and any special
      conditions applicable to the AMPEL360 WTW type design basis.
    rationale: "Type certification basis governs per normative hierarchy."
