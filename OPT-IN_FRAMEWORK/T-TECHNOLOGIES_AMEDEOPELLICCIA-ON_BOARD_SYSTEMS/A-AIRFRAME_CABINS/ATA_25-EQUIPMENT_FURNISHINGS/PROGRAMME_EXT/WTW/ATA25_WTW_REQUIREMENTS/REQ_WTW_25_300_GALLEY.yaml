requirements:
  - req_id: WTW-25-300-001
    title: "Galley bay locations — WTW fuselage section breaks"
    shall: >
      Galley bays shall be positioned within fuselage section TBD–TBD (per Type Design
      structural layout). Floor sill fittings for galley structural attachment shall be
      per ICD_WTW_ATTACH_POINTS_001.md.
    rationale: "WTW galley bay geometry is constrained by fuselage section joints and floor beam spacing."
    verification: Dimensional inspection + drawing compliance
    lc_gate: LC03

  - req_id: WTW-25-300-002
    title: "Galley flammability"
    shall: >
      All galley insert (GAIN) panels, curtain materials, and surrounding cabin panels
      shall comply with CS-25.853 as registered in TEST_WTW_FLAMMABILITY_25_853.md.
    rationale: "WTW-specific galley configurations may use different materials than BWB."
    verification: Test per CS-25.853 Appendix F
    cs25_ref: "CS-25.853"
    lc_gate: LC06

  - req_id: WTW-25-300-003
    title: "Galley water/waste interface"
    shall: >
      Galley drain and water supply connections shall be compatible with the WTW
      ATA 38 plumbing routing (drain path runs aft on WTW; differs from BWB central drain).
    rationale: "WTW lower lobe drain routing differs from BWB distributed bilge."
    verification: Interface check vs ATA 38 ICD
    lc_gate: LC03
