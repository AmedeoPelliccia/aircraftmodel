requirements:
  - req_id: WTW-25-400-001
    title: "Lavatory envelope — WTW circular fuselage constraint"
    shall: >
      Lavatory module outer envelope shall fit within the WTW cabin cross-section
      (see ICD_WTW_CABIN_GEOM_001.md) with minimum TBD mm clearance to sidewall structure.
    rationale: "WTW circular fuselage cross-section constrains lavatory width at floor level differently than BWB."
    verification: Dimensional inspection
    lc_gate: LC03

  - req_id: WTW-25-400-002
    title: "Lavatory drain routing — WTW"
    shall: >
      Lavatory drain connections shall be routed to the WTW waste system interface
      (ATA 38). WTW drain routing runs aft-lower; shall not penetrate floor beam
      flange without approved penetration (ATA 53 approval required).
    rationale: "WTW floor beam layout differs from BWB; penetration requires structural approval."
    verification: Interface check vs ATA 38 and ATA 53 ICD
    lc_gate: LC03

  - req_id: WTW-25-400-003
    title: "Lavatory flammability"
    shall: >
      All lavatory panels, liner materials, and fittings shall comply with CS-25.853
      as registered in TEST_WTW_FLAMMABILITY_25_853.md.
    rationale: "WTW lavatory material variants shall be tracked."
    verification: Test per CS-25.853 Appendix F
    cs25_ref: "CS-25.853"
    lc_gate: LC06

  - req_id: WTW-25-400-004
    title: "Lavatory smoke detector"
    shall: >
      Each WTW lavatory shall be equipped with a smoke detector meeting CS-25.854
      and connected to the WTW cabin attendant panel (ATA 26/ATA 44 interface).
    rationale: "CS-25.854 mandatory; WTW lavatory locations and wiring routing are variant-specific."
    verification: Functional test
