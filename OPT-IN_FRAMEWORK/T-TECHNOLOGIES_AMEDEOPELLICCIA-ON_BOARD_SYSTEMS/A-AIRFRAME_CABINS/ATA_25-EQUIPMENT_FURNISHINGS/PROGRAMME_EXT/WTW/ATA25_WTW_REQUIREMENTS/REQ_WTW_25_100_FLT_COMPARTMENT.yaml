requirements:
  - req_id: WTW-25-100-001
    title: "Flight deck seat attach — WTW seat track compatibility"
    shall: >
      Flight deck crew seats shall be installed on WTW-variant seat tracks
      (type TBD, see ICD_WTW_ATTACH_POINTS_001.md) and demonstrate CS-25.562
      dynamic test compliance using WTW-specific track geometry.
    rationale: "WTW flight deck floor geometry differs from BWB; generic seat track data insufficient."
    verification: Analysis (CS-25.562) + Test (if analysis not sufficient)
    cs25_ref: "CS-25.562"
    lc_gate: LC03

  - req_id: WTW-25-100-002
    title: "Flight deck headroom"
    shall: >
      Installed flight deck equipment height shall not reduce occupant egress path
      height below TBD mm (from Type Design cabin data).
    rationale: "WTW flight deck crown geometry constrains max equipment height."
    verification: Dimensional inspection
    lc_gate: LC03

  - req_id: WTW-25-100-003
    title: "Flight deck emergency equipment stowage"
    shall: >
      Emergency equipment stowage locations in the WTW flight deck shall be accessible
      in ≤TBD seconds by a seated crew member with harness fastened.
    rationale: "CS-25.1411 accessibility; WTW cockpit layout may differ from BWB."
    verification: Inspection / functional demonstration
