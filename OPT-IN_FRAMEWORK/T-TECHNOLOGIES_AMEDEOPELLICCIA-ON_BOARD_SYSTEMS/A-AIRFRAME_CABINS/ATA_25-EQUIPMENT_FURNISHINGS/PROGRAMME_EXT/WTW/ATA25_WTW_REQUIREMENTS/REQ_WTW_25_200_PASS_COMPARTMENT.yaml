requirements:
  - req_id: WTW-25-200-001
    title: "Passenger seat installation — WTW track geometry"
    shall: >
      Passenger seats shall be installed on WTW seat tracks (see ICD_WTW_ATTACH_POINTS_001.md).
      Seat pitch, lateral position, and fitting engagement shall comply with drawing and
      demonstrate CS-25.561 compliance using WTW floor-beam load introduction geometry.
    rationale: "WTW floor beam spacing and seat track pitch differ from BWB distributed floor."
    verification: Analysis (CS-25.561) + dimensional inspection
    cs25_ref: "CS-25.561"
    lc_gate: LC03

  - req_id: WTW-25-200-002
    title: "Overhead bin envelope — WTW frame/stringer clearance"
    shall: >
      Overhead bin outer envelope shall maintain minimum TBD mm clearance to fuselage
      frame inner flange and stringer caps (see ICD_WTW_CABIN_GEOM_001.md).
    rationale: "WTW circular fuselage frames intrude on overhead bin envelope differently to BWB."
    verification: Dimensional inspection / drawing check
    lc_gate: LC03

  - req_id: WTW-25-200-003
    title: "Cabin interior materials — flammability (WTW)"
    shall: >
      All cabin interior materials (seats, panels, bins, carpets) shall comply with
      CS-25.853 flammability requirements. WTW-specific material qualification data
      shall be registered in TEST_WTW_FLAMMABILITY_25_853.md.
    rationale: "Variant-specific material variants may be used in WTW that differ from BWB."
    verification: Test per CS-25.853 Appendix F
    cs25_ref: "CS-25.853"
    lc_gate: LC06

  - req_id: WTW-25-200-004
    title: "Aisle width — WTW"
    shall: >
      Aisle width at armrest level shall meet CS-25 minimum (TBD mm) with all seats
      in the upright position. WTW 9-abreast configuration shall be verified with
      installed seat dimensions.
    rationale: "Aisle width compliance is WTW-seating-configuration-dependent."
    verification: Dimensional inspection
    lc_gate: LC03
