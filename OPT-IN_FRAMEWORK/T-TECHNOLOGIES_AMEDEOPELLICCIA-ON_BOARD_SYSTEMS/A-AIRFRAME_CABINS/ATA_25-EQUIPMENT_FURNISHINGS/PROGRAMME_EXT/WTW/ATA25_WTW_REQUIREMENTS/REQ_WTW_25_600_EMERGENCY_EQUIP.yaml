  - req_id: WTW-25-600-001
    title: "Emergency exit count and type — WTW"
    shall: >
      The WTW variant shall provide emergency exits of type and number compliant with
      CS-25.803 for the certified maximum passenger capacity. Exit locations shall be
      as defined in Type Design emergency exit map (TBD at LC03).
    rationale: "WTW cabin length and door spacing differ from BWB; exit count/type is variant-specific."
    verification: Compliance matrix review + physical inspection

      Emergency exit floor path lighting and exit marking shall comply with CS-25.810
      for WTW cabin layout. Lighting bus connection shall be per ATA 24 WTW electrical ICD.
    rationale: "WTW cabin aisle geometry and exit spacing drive lighting layout."
    verification: Functional test (illumination level per CS-25.810)
