**Doc ID:** T-A-ATA25-WTW-ACC-001
**Variant:** WTW
**Lifecycle:** LC01 (scaffold — limits at LC04)
**Parent:** [Acceptability README](README.md)

## Scope

WTW-specific acceptance criteria for new and re-installation of cabin equipment/furnishings.
Supplements SHARED ATA 25 acceptability criteria with WTW-specific limits where they differ.

---

## 1) Seat Installation

| Parameter | Acceptance Limit | Measurement Method | Notes |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------------|-------|
| Track fitting engagement | TBD mm minimum engagement | Visual + pull test | Per seat manufacturer CMM |
| Seat pitch tolerance | ±TBD mm of nominal | Tape measure | Per drawing |
| Seat lateral alignment | ±TBD mm from track centreline | Tape measure | Per drawing |
| Fitting torque | Per approved torque table (see ATA 20) | Calibrated torque wrench | WTW track fitting PN |

## 2) Monument (Galley/Lavatory) Installation

| Parameter | Acceptance Limit | Measurement Method |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Vertical plumb | ≤TBD mm/m lean | Spirit level |
| Attach torque | Per drawing / CMM | Calibrated torque wrench |
| Overhead attach engagement | TBD mm minimum | Visual inspection |
| Gap to adjacent structure | TBD mm minimum (no interference) | Feeler gauge |

---

## 3) Overhead Bin Installation

| Parameter | Acceptance Limit | Measurement Method |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Attachment to frame/strongback | TBD mm engagement (all fittings engaged) | Visual |
| Drop test | Latch holds per CMM requirement | Functional test |
| Clearance to frame | ≥TBD mm (see ICD_WTW_CABIN_GEOM_001.md) | Ruler |

## 4) Open Actions

> Acceptance limits marked TBD to be populated at LC03–LC04 from Type Design and CMM data.
