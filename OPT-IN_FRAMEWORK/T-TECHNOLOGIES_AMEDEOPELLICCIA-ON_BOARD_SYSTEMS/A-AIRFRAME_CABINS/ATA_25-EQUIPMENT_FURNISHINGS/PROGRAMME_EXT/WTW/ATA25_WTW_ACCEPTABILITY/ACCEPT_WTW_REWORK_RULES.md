# ATA 25 WTW — Rework Rules

**Doc ID:** T-A-ATA25-WTW-ACC-003
**Variant:** WTW
**Lifecycle:** LC01 (scaffold — rework data at LC04–LC05)
**Parent:** [Acceptability README](README.md)

## Scope

Approved rework and repair methods for WTW cabin equipment and furnishings.
These are delta rules supplementing SHARED ATA 25 and ATA 20 standard practices.

---

## 1) Seat Track Rework

| Condition | Approved Rework | Approval Level |
|-----------|----------------|---------------|
| Track fitting worn within CMM limits | Replace fitting per CMM | MRO |
| Track slot elongated within SRM limits | Upsize per ATA 20 rework ladder | MRO (ATA 20 ref) |
| Track slot elongated beyond SRM | Engineering disposition | Engineering |
| Crack in track extrusion | Engineering disposition — replacement likely | Engineering |

## 2) Panel / Lining Rework

| Condition | Approved Rework | Approval Level |
|-----------|----------------|---------------|
| Surface scratch, paint only | Touch-up per approved paint scheme | Cabin crew / line MX |
| Panel core damage (non-structural) | CMM bonded repair with approved adhesive | MRO |
| Panel core damage (structural — if applicable) | ATA 20 composite repair rules apply | Engineering + MRO |
| Panel attachment hole elongated | Replace panel; re-drill to next size only if within drawing tolerance | MRO |

## 3) Flammability Re-qualification After Repair

- Any rework that replaces or adds material different from the originally approved material
  **shall** be re-qualified for CS-25.853 flammability.
- Evidence to be registered in [TEST_WTW_FLAMMABILITY_25_853.md](../ATA25_WTW_VERIFICATION_EVIDENCE/TEST_WTW_FLAMMABILITY_25_853.md).

---

## 4) General Rework Principles

- All rework shall follow ATA 20 standard practices unless this document explicitly specifies otherwise.
- Rework that affects CS-25 compliance **shall** be reviewed by the Certifying Engineer before return to service.
- Material traceability (batch/shelf-life) shall be recorded per ATA 20 §8.2.
