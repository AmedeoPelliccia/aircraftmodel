# ATA 25 BWB — Rework Rules

**Doc ID:** T-A-ATA25-BWB-ACC-003
**Variant:** BWB
**Lifecycle:** LC01 (scaffold — rework data at LC04–LC05)
**Parent:** [Acceptability README](README.md)

---

## Scope

Approved rework and repair methods for BWB cabin equipment and furnishings.
Delta rules supplementing SHARED ATA 25 and ATA 20 standard practices for BWB composite
structure and floor grid.

---

## 1) Floor Grid Node Rework

| Condition | Approved Rework | Approval Level |
|-----------|----------------|---------------|
| Node fitting worn within CMM limits | Replace fitting per CMM | MRO |
| Node insert elongated within SRM limits | Composite insert rework per ATA 20 composite rework ladder | MRO + ATA 20 ref |
| Node insert elongated beyond SRM | Engineering disposition | Engineering |
| Crack in composite floor panel adjacent to node | ATA 20 composite repair rules apply (see ATA 20) | Engineering + MRO |

---

## 2) Panel / Lining Rework (Composite Interior)

| Condition | Approved Rework | Approval Level |
|-----------|----------------|---------------|
| Surface scratch, paint only | Touch-up per approved paint scheme | Cabin crew / line MX |
| Panel core damage (honeycomb, non-structural) | CMM bonded repair per approved process | MRO |
| Panel core damage (structural — spar bay face sheet) | ATA 20 composite repair rules + ATA 53 sign-off | Engineering + MRO |
| Delamination in composite bay panel | Engineering disposition (size-dependent) | Engineering |

---

## 3) Floor Grid Fitting Replacement

Replacement of a floor grid node fitting shall be carried out per the approved BWB
floor grid repair procedure (document TBD — to be published at LC04). The procedure shall:

- Confirm parent grid structure is undamaged before fitting replacement.
- Use approved adhesive/fastener system per ATA 20 composite bonding standards.
- Re-verify torque and pull-out load after replacement.

---

## 4) Flammability Re-qualification After Repair

- Any rework replacing material with a non-approved material **shall** trigger CS-25.853
  re-qualification. Evidence registered in [TEST_BWB_FLAMMABILITY_25_853.md](../ATA25_BWB_VERIFICATION_EVIDENCE/TEST_BWB_FLAMMABILITY_25_853.md).
- Material traceability (batch/shelf-life) shall be recorded per ATA 20 §8.2.

---

## 5) General Principles

- All rework follows ATA 20 standard practices unless this document explicitly specifies otherwise.
- BWB composite-specific rework follows ATA 20 composite section (coordinate with ATA 53 CMM for structural zones).
- Rework affecting CS-25 compliance shall be reviewed by the Certifying Engineer before return to service.
