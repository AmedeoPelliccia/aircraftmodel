# ATA 25 BWB — Clearances and Access

**Doc ID:** T-A-ATA25-BWB-ACC-002
**Variant:** BWB
**Lifecycle:** LC01 (scaffold — limits at LC04–LC05)
**Parent:** [Acceptability README](README.md)

## Scope

BWB-specific clearance and maintenance access acceptability criteria for cabin
equipment. The BWB distributed bay layout and composite structure drive unique
clearance and access requirements not present in WTW.

---

## 1) Spar Bay Clearances

| Interface | Minimum Clearance | Method | Notes |
|-----------|------------------|--------|-------|
| Equipment to spar web | TBD mm | Feeler gauge / ruler | No contact with spar structure |
| Equipment to spar cap | TBD mm | Ruler | Per ICD_BWB_CABIN_ENVELOPE_001.md |
| Monument to fire-zone boundary seal | TBD mm (seal not pinched) | Visual + compression check | ATA 26 fire zone integrity |
| Overhead bin to crown soffit | TBD mm | Ruler | Per ICD_BWB_STOWAGE_DISTRIBUTION_001.md |

---

## 2) Maintenance Access Envelopes

| Zone | Access requirement | Clearance to obstacles | Notes |
|------|-------------------|----------------------|-------|
| Floor grid node (in-bay) | Panel removal + fitting access | TBD mm removal envelope clear | Maintenance tooling PN TBD |
| Overhead soffit hanger | Access hatch + fitting access | TBD mm | Crown access panel spacing |
| Monument attach fitting | Monument partial removal | TBD mm removal clearance | Per monument removal procedure |
| Spar-web fitting (lateral reaction) | Local panel removal | TBD mm | ATA 53 spar-bay access panel |

---

## 3) Egress Path Clearances

See [ACC_BWB_INSTALLATION_TOLERANCES.md](ACC_BWB_INSTALLATION_TOLERANCES.md) for monument gap limits.

Egress path minimum widths (from ICD_BWB_EGRESS_CLEARANCES_001.md):

| Aisle / Path | Minimum width (installed) | Method |
|-------------|--------------------------|--------|
| Radial aisle to exit | TBD mm (CS-25 min) | Tape measure |
| Cross-aisle (between bays) | TBD mm | Tape measure |
| Exit sill equipment-free zone | TBD mm radius | Radius template |
