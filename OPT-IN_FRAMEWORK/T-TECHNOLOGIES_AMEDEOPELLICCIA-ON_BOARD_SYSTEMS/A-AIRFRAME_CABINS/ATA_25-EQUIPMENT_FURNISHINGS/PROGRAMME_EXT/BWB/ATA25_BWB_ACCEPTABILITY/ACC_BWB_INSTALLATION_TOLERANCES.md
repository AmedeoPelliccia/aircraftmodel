# ATA 25 BWB — Installation Tolerances

**Doc ID:** T-A-ATA25-BWB-ACC-001
**Variant:** BWB
**Lifecycle:** LC01 (scaffold — limits at LC04)
**Parent:** [Acceptability README](README.md)

---

## Scope

BWB-specific acceptance criteria for new and re-installation of cabin equipment/furnishings.
Supplements SHARED ATA 25 tolerances with BWB-specific limits where the floor grid and
composite structure differ from WTW circular fuselage.

---

## 1) Seat Installation (Floor Grid)

| Parameter | Acceptance Limit | Measurement Method | Notes |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------------|-------|
| Grid node fitting engagement | TBD mm minimum (all nodes) | Visual + pull test | BWB grid fitting PN TBD |
| Seat fore-aft position tolerance | ±TBD mm of nominal node | Tape measure / grid template | Per drawing |
| Seat lateral position tolerance | ±TBD mm of nominal node | Tape measure / grid template | Per drawing |
| Fitting torque | Per approved torque table (ATA 20) | Calibrated torque wrench | BWB grid fitting PN |

## 2) Monument (Galley/Lavatory) Installation

| Parameter | Acceptance Limit | Measurement Method |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Vertical plumb | ≤TBD mm/m lean | Spirit level |
| Floor node attach torque | Per drawing / CMM | Calibrated torque wrench |
| Overhead soffit fitting engagement | TBD mm minimum (where fitted) | Visual inspection |
| Gap to spar web | ≥TBD mm (no contact) | Feeler gauge |
| Gap to adjacent monument/seat | ≥TBD mm at all egress paths | Tape measure |

---

## 3) Overhead Bin Installation (Crown Zone)

| Parameter | Acceptance Limit | Measurement Method |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Soffit hanger engagement | TBD mm minimum (all hangers) | Visual |
| Clearance to spar cap | ≥TBD mm (see ICD_BWB_CABIN_ENVELOPE_001.md) | Ruler |
| Latch functional check | Latch holds per CMM spec | Functional test |
| Lateral reach from spar bay centroid | Within TBD mm (no bay bridging without approval) | Tape measure |

---

## 4) Open Actions

> Tolerances marked TBD to be populated at LC03–LC04 from Type Design and CMM data.
