requirements:
  - req_id: BWB-25-500-001
    title: "Cargo liner attachment — BWB lower body composite structure"
    shall: >
      Cargo compartment liner panels shall be attached to BWB lower-body composite
      frames and skin per approved attachment scheme (PN and spacing TBD at LC03).
      Liner attachment shall not penetrate the pressure vessel composite skin without
      an approved sealed fastener scheme (ATA 53 approval required).
    rationale: "BWB lower body uses composite co-cured skin panels; liner attachment differs from WTW aluminium lower lobe."
    verification: Dimensional inspection + assembly compliance check
    lc_gate: LC03

  - req_id: BWB-25-500-002
    title: "Cargo liner flammability (BWB)"
    shall: >
      All BWB cargo compartment liner materials shall meet CS-25.853 class C (or as
      specified in Type Design for BWB). Material qualification records shall be
      registered in TEST_BWB_FLAMMABILITY_25_853.md.
    rationale: "BWB composite cargo bay structure requires compatible liner materials."
    verification: Test per CS-25.853 Appendix F
    cs25_ref: "CS-25.853"
    lc_gate: LC06

  - req_id: BWB-25-500-003
    title: "Cargo bay liner – access panel clearance (BWB)"
    shall: >
      Cargo liner panels shall maintain minimum TBD mm clearance to all access panels,
      maintenance hatches, and structural inspection ports in the BWB lower body.
      BWB has distributed maintenance access in lower composite bays (ATA 52/ATA 53).
    rationale: "BWB maintenance access philosophy differs from conventional aft cargo door; distributed panel removal must not be impeded by liners."
    verification: Dimensional inspection with panels removed and reinstalled
    lc_gate: LC03
