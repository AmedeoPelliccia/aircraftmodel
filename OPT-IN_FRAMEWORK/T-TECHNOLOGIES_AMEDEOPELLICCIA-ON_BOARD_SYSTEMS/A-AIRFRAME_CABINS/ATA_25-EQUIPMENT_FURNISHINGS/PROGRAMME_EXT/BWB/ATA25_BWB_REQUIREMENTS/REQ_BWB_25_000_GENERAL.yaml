requirements:
  - req_id: BWB-25-000-001
    title: "Overlay non-duplication"
    shall: >
      BWB-specific ATA 25 content shall supplement, not duplicate, SHARED baseline
      content in the ATA_25 root. Where BWB-specific thresholds differ from SHARED,
      the BWB threshold governs for AMPEL360 BWB.
    rationale: "Prevents configuration drift between SHARED and variant-specific content."
    verification: Configuration audit (CM)

  - req_id: BWB-25-000-002
    title: "CS-25 applicability"
    shall: >
      All BWB ATA 25 equipment installations shall comply with applicable CS-25
      regulations (as listed in ATA25_BWB_COMPLIANCE_MATRIX.md) and any special
      conditions applicable to the AMPEL360 BWB type design basis.
    rationale: "Type certification basis governs per normative hierarchy. BWB may have novel/unusual design special conditions."
    verification: Compliance matrix review

  - req_id: BWB-25-000-003
    title: "Bay-bridging prohibition"
    shall: >
      No equipment, monument, or structure shall bridge adjacent spar bays without
      an approved bay-bridging scheme (floating interface, structural penetration, or
      approved floating connection). Bay boundaries per ICD_BWB_CABIN_ENVELOPE_001.md.
    rationale: "BWB spar bays are structurally and thermally/fire-zone isolated; bridging without approval risks structural and fire-containment integrity."
