requirements:
  - req_id: BWB-25-300-001
    title: "Galley attachment — BWB floor grid and overhead reaction"
    shall: >
      Galley monuments shall be attached to BWB floor grid nodes (primary load) and
      overhead soffit fittings (reaction load, where mass > TBD kg), per
      ICD_BWB_MONUMENT_INTERFACES_001.md. Load path analysis shall demonstrate
      CS-25.561 compliance using BWB structural geometry.
    rationale: "BWB galley bays attach to composite torque-box structure, not tube-and-wing floor beams."
    verification: Analysis (CS-25.561) + dimensional inspection
    cs25_ref: "CS-25.561"
    lc_gate: LC03

  - req_id: BWB-25-300-002
    title: "Galley bay location — within single spar bay"
    shall: >
      Each galley unit shall be located within a single spar bay unless an approved
      bay-bridging scheme is in place per BWB-25-000-003. Galley footprint shall
      not cross a spar web without structural approval (ATA 53 coordination).
    rationale: "Fire zone separation between spar bays; monument crossing introduces structural and fire-containment risk."
    verification: Drawing compliance check + ATA 53 sign-off
    lc_gate: LC03

  - req_id: BWB-25-300-003
    title: "Galley flammability (BWB)"
    shall: >
      All galley insert panels, curtain materials, and surrounding cabin panels
      shall comply with CS-25.853 as registered in TEST_BWB_FLAMMABILITY_25_853.md.
    rationale: "BWB galley materials may differ from WTW; variant-specific tracking required."
    verification: Test per CS-25.853 Appendix F
    cs25_ref: "CS-25.853"
    lc_gate: LC06

  - req_id: BWB-25-300-004
    title: "Galley water/waste interface — BWB routing"
    shall: >
      Galley drain and water supply connections shall be routed through the BWB
      floor grid zones per ATA 38 BWB routing. Floor grid node penetration for
      plumbing shall use approved sealed pass-throughs (ATA 53 coordination).
    rationale: "BWB distributed floor grid differs from conventional tube fuselage; plumbing routing must avoid grid node fittings."
    verification: Interface check vs ATA 38 ICD
