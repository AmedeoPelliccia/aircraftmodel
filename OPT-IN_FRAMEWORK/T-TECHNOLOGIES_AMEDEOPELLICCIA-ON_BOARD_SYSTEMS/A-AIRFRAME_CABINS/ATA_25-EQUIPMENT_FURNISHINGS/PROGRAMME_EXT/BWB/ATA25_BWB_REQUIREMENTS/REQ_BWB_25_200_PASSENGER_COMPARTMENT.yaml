requirements:
  - req_id: BWB-25-200-001
    title: "Seat installation — BWB floor grid compatibility"
    shall: >
      Passenger seats shall be installed on BWB floor grid nodes
      (see ICD_BWB_FLOOR_GRID_ATTACH_001.md) with fitting engagement per
      approved fitting PN. Seat node pitch, lateral position, and engagement depth
      shall comply with drawing and demonstrate CS-25.561 compliance using BWB
      distributed-grid load introduction geometry.
    rationale: "BWB floor grid is fundamentally different from WTW seat tracks."
    verification: Analysis (CS-25.561) + dimensional inspection
    cs25_ref: "CS-25.561"
    lc_gate: LC03

  - req_id: BWB-25-200-002
    title: "Overhead bin envelope — BWB spar/crown clearance"
    shall: >
      Overhead bin outer envelope shall maintain minimum TBD mm clearance to BWB
      spar cap inner surface and crown composite structure
      (see ICD_BWB_CABIN_ENVELOPE_001.md). Bins shall not bridge spar bays without
      an approved floating interface per BWB-25-000-003.
    rationale: "BWB crown geometry and spar bay separation differ from WTW round cross-section."
    verification: Dimensional inspection / drawing check
    lc_gate: LC03

  - req_id: BWB-25-200-003
    title: "Cabin interior materials — flammability (BWB)"
    shall: >
      All BWB cabin interior materials (seats, panels, bins, carpets) shall comply
      with CS-25.853. BWB-specific material variants shall be registered in
      TEST_BWB_FLAMMABILITY_25_853.md.
    rationale: "BWB may use composite-compatible interior materials differing from WTW."
    verification: Test per CS-25.853 Appendix F
    cs25_ref: "CS-25.853"
    lc_gate: LC06

  - req_id: BWB-25-200-004
    title: "Stowage distribution — lateral CG management"
    shall: >
      BWB overhead stowage distribution shall comply with the zone limits in
      ICD_BWB_STOWAGE_DISTRIBUTION_001.md. Lateral bin loading creating lateral
      CG offset ≥ TBD kg-m shall trigger a cabin management system alert (ATA 44).
    rationale: "BWB stowage spans planform; lateral asymmetry creates trim/balance effects unique to BWB."
    verification: Weight and balance analysis + functional test (ATA 44 interface)
