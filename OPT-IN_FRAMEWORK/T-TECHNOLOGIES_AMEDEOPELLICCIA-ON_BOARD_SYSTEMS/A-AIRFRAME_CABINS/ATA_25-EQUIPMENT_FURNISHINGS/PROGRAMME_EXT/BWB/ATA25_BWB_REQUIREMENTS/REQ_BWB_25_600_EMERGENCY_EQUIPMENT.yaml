requirements:
  - req_id: BWB-25-600-001
    title: "Emergency exit count, type, and distribution (BWB)"
    shall: >
      The BWB variant shall provide emergency exits of type and number compliant with
      CS-25.803 for the certified maximum passenger capacity, with exits distributed
      to serve multi-zone cabin areas per the BWB radial evacuation model.
      Exit locations shall be per ICD_BWB_EGRESS_CLEARANCES_001.md.
    rationale: "BWB multi-zone radial cabin evacuation differs from tube-and-wing; exit distribution must be re-analysed."
    verification: Compliance matrix + physical inspection + evacuation analysis
    cs25_ref: "CS-25.803"
    lc_gate: LC03

  - req_id: BWB-25-600-002
    title: "Emergency floor path lighting — BWB radial aisles"
    shall: >
      Emergency floor path lighting shall guide passengers radially towards the
      nearest exit in the BWB multi-zone cabin layout. Lighting path shall be
      continuous to all exits for all zone configurations.
      Lighting bus connection per ATA 24 BWB electrical ICD.
    rationale: "BWB radial egress requires different floor-path geometry than fore-aft linear lighting."
    verification: Functional test (illumination level per CS-25.810) in all lighting failure modes
    cs25_ref: "CS-25.810"
    lc_gate: LC04

  - req_id: BWB-25-600-003
    title: "Safety equipment stowage — BWB multi-zone"
    shall: >
      Life vests, portable O₂, first-aid kits, and crash axe shall be stowed at
      BWB-variant zonal locations (one set per cabin zone, per ICD_BWB_EGRESS_CLEARANCES_001.md)
      and be retrievable in ≤TBD seconds.
    rationale: "BWB wide planform means centralised stowage is not accessible from all zones; per-zone stowage required."
    verification: Functional inspection (each zone)
    cs25_ref: "CS-25.1411"
    lc_gate: LC04

  - req_id: BWB-25-600-004
    title: "Evacuation slide / slide-raft provision (BWB)"
    shall: >
      Each BWB Type A and Type C exit shall be equipped with an approved evacuation
      slide or slide-raft per CS-25.809. BWB exit orientation (potentially at leading
      or trailing edge of wing body) shall be accounted for in slide deployment geometry.
    rationale: "BWB exit geometry and orientation at non-conventional locations drives unique slide deployment envelope."
    verification: Ground demonstration (CS-25.809) + inspection
    cs25_ref: "CS-25.809"
    lc_gate: LC06

  - req_id: BWB-25-600-005
    title: "Egress clearance — floor fitting-free zone at exits"
    shall: >
      No floor fitting, seat track, or monument shall be located within TBD mm
      (radial) of any emergency exit sill (see ICD_BWB_EGRESS_CLEARANCES_001.md).
    rationale: "BWB radial flow geometry; obstructions in radial clearance zone increase evacuation time."
    verification: Dimensional inspection (each exit)
    lc_gate: LC03
