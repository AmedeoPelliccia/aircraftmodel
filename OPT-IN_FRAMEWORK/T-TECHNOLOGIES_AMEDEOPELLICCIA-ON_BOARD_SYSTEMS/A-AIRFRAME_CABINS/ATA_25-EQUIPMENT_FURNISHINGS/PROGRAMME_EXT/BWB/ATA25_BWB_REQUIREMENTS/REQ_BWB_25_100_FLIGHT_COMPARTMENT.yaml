requirements:
  - req_id: BWB-25-100-001
    title: "Flight deck seat attachment — BWB floor grid"
    shall: >
      Flight deck crew seats shall be installed on BWB floor grid nodes
      (see ICD_BWB_FLOOR_GRID_ATTACH_001.md) and demonstrate CS-25.562 dynamic
      test compliance using BWB-specific grid geometry and load introduction points.
    rationale: "BWB flight deck embedded in wing body with grid floor; different from WTW and from tube-and-wing."
    verification: Analysis (CS-25.562) + Test (if analysis insufficient)

  - req_id: BWB-25-100-002
    title: "Flight deck emergency egress — BWB geometry"
    shall: >
      BWB flight deck emergency egress (door/hatch to cabin or direct exit) shall
      provide an unobstructed path complying with CS-25 minimum dimensions.
      BWB-specific geometry constraints (embedded deck, spar bay proximity) shall
      be verified per ICD_BWB_EGRESS_CLEARANCES_001.md.
    rationale: "BWB flight deck geometry differs from conventional cockpit; escape path must be re-verified."
    verification: Dimensional inspection

  - req_id: BWB-25-100-003
    title: "Flight deck emergency equipment stowage — BWB"
    shall: >
      Emergency equipment stowage in the BWB flight deck shall be accessible
      in ≤TBD seconds by a seated crew member with harness fastened.
      Stowage locations constrained by BWB flight deck envelope.
    rationale: "BWB cockpit crown is lower and forward access differs from conventional cockpit."
    verification: Inspection / functional demonstration
