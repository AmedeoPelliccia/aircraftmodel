requirements:
  - req_id: BWB-25-400-001
    title: "Lavatory envelope — BWB bay and crown constraint"
    shall: >
      Lavatory module outer envelope shall fit within the BWB cabin bay cross-section
      (see ICD_BWB_CABIN_ENVELOPE_001.md) with minimum TBD mm clearance to spar web
      and sidewall composite structure.
    rationale: "BWB spar bay constrains lavatory width differently than WTW circular fuselage."
    verification: Dimensional inspection
    lc_gate: LC03

  - req_id: BWB-25-400-002
    title: "Lavatory attachment — BWB floor grid"
    shall: >
      Lavatory units ≤ TBD kg shall attach to floor grid nodes only
      (see ICD_BWB_MONUMENT_INTERFACES_001.md). Units > TBD kg shall use
      additional overhead soffit reaction fitting.
    rationale: "BWB floor grid node load capacity limits require mass-based attachment scheme selection."
    verification: Dimensional inspection + load analysis check

  - req_id: BWB-25-400-003
    title: "Lavatory flammability (BWB)"
    shall: >
      All lavatory panels, liner materials, and fittings shall comply with CS-25.853
      as registered in TEST_BWB_FLAMMABILITY_25_853.md.
    rationale: "BWB lavatory material variants shall be tracked separately."
    verification: Test per CS-25.853 Appendix F

    lc_gate: LC06

  - req_id: BWB-25-400-004
    title: "Lavatory smoke detector (BWB)"
    shall: >
      Each BWB lavatory shall be equipped with a smoke detector per CS-25.854
      connected to the BWB cabin attendant panel (ATA 26/ATA 44 interface).
      BWB lavatory locations and wiring routing are bay-specific.
    rationale: "CS-25.854 mandatory; routing differs per spar bay location."
    verification: Functional test
