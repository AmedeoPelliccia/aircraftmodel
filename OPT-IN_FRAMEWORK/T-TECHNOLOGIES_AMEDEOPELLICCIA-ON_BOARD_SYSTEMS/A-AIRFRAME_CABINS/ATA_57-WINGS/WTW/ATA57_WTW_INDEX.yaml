  This index is the Single Source of Truth (SSOT) for all WTW deviations
  from the ATA 57 SHARED baseline. No SHARED content shall be duplicated here.
  All entries are delta statements with traceable references.

    title: Conventional swept CFRP wing primary structure
    type: ΔARCH
    description: >
      WTW uses a conventional swept wing box with CFRP skin panels, CFRP spars,
      and aluminium/titanium rib structures. This differs from BWB, where wing
      and body are structurally integrated. SHARED baseline ATA 57 is neutral;
      WTW-specific geometry, rib spacing registers, and attach-point topology
      are defined in this overlay.

    title: Rib spacing optimisation (8-bit discrete register)
    type: ΔREQ
    description: >
      WTW rib spacing is optimised via a secondary module (SECONDARY_RIB_SPACING_OPT/)
      using discrete 8-bit registers per rib bay. Constraints are fatigue life
      (minimum 80,000 flight cycles) and aeroelastic divergence speed margin
      (≥ 15% above VD/MD). SHARED baseline does not specify rib spacing rules.

    title: Wing-fuselage attach philosophy (conventional stub-spar)
    type: ΔICD
    description: >
      WTW uses conventional stub-spar wing-fuselage attach with four main fittings
      (front spar, rear spar, lower chord, upper chord). Load transfer path is via
      pin-jointed fittings into fuselage frames at FR-XX/FR-YY (TBD). This is
      WTW-specific; BWB has no equivalent discrete attach.

    title: Control surface interface (aileron and spoileron)
    type: ΔICD
    description: >
      WTW aileron and spoileron hinge-line and actuator hard-point geometry are
      defined by this overlay. Hinge-line orientation follows wing rear spar sweep.
      Actuator attach brackets are metallic (Ti-6Al-4V) bonded+bolted to CFRP rear spar.

    title: Fuel/LH₂ tank integration provisions
    type: ΔICD
    description: >
      WTW wing tanks use sealed CFRP wet wing configuration. LH₂ variant provisions
      include thermally isolated bay sections and additional rib sealing compound.
      Rib spacing register must account for LH₂ tank bay boundaries (minimum bay
      length ≥ TBD mm to accommodate cryogenic insulation blanket).

    title: Maintenance plan registry hook
    type: ΔMAINT
    description: >
      WTW wing maintenance classification uses the SSOT maintenance plan registry
      under MAINTENANCE/MAINT_PLAN_REGISTRY.yaml. Repair categories (structural,
      cosmetic, nested composite), spare part classification, supplier responsibility,
      and material circularity tier are registered here per CS-25.1529 / AMM linkage.
