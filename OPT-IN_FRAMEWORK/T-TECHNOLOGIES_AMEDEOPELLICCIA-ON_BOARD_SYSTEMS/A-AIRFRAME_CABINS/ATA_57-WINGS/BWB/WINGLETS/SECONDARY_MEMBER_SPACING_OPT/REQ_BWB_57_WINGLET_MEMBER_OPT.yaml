    title: Member spacing encoding conformance
    shall: >
      The winglet member spacing optimisation module SHALL encode all bay spacing design variables
      as 8-bit integer registers (values 0–255) per the encoding standard defined in
      STD_MEMBER_SPACING_8BIT_ENCODING.md. Member primitives SHALL use neutral names
      (member_spanwise, member_chordwise) with region: outboard aliasing.
    rationale: >
      8-bit discretisation ensures reproducibility and consistent encoding with the
      WTW rib spacing and BWB blend zone TDF optimisation modules. Neutral naming
      maintains geometry independence for different winglet planform configurations.

  - req_id: BWB-57-WG-002
    title: Inboard boundary condition from blend zone
    shall: >
      The winglet member spacing optimisation SHALL use the blend zone outboard stiffness
      (from BLEND_ZONE/SECONDARY_TOPOLOGY_FIELD_OPT/) as the inboard structural boundary
      condition at the winglet root (η ≈ 0.85). The two optimisation modules SHALL be
      co-ordinated to ensure structural continuity at the blend zone / winglet interface.
    rationale: >
      The BWB blend zone and winglet form a structurally continuous system. Optimising
      each independently with incompatible boundary conditions would produce a discontinuity
      at the interface that cannot be certified.

  - req_id: BWB-57-WG-003
    title: Fatigue life constraint compliance
    shall: >
      The member spacing register pack SHALL satisfy the fatigue life constraint C-FATIGUE
      defined in CONSTRAINTS_FATIGUE_AND_DIVERGENCE.md: Miner damage sum D ≤ 0.5
      (= 1.0 / γ, γ = 2.0) for 80,000 flight cycles at the AMPEL360 BWB winglet load spectrum.
    rationale: >
      CS-25.571(a) requires damage-tolerant structure. Winglet loads include local gust
      response amplification; the winglet fatigue spectrum must be separately defined from
      the main wing spectrum.

  - req_id: BWB-57-WG-004
    title: Aeroelastic divergence constraint compliance
    shall: >
      The member spacing register pack SHALL satisfy the aeroelastic divergence constraint
      C-DIVERGENCE: V_div ≥ 1.15 × VD per CS-25.629(d), evaluated by DLM eigenvalue analysis
      of the winglet bending/torsion stiffness matrix with inboard boundary from blend zone.
    rationale: >
      CS-25.629(d) requires demonstration of adequate divergence margin. The winglet
      torsional stiffness is directly governed by member spacing and must be maintained
      above the divergence threshold. The blend zone inboard stiffness is a key input.

  - req_id: BWB-57-WG-005
    title: Member spacing optimisation determinism and reproducibility
    shall: >
      The winglet member spacing optimisation solver SHALL be deterministic and reproducible:
      identical inputs (bay definitions, load spectrum, constraint bounds, solver config)
      SHALL produce identical register packs on repeated runs. A SHA-256 hash of the
      register pack SHALL be recorded per solver run.
    rationale: >
      Certification traceability requires unique identification of the design variable set.
      Non-deterministic solvers cannot produce traceable register pack versions.
