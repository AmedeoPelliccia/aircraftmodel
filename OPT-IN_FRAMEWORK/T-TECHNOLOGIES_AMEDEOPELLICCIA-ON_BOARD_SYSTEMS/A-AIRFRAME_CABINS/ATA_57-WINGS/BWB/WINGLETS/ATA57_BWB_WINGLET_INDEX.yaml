  This index is the Single Source of Truth (SSOT) for all WINGLETS deviations
  from the ATA 57 SHARED baseline. No SHARED content shall be duplicated.
  The winglet uses neutral member primitives (member_spanwise = rib alias,
  member_chordwise = stringer alias) with region: outboard aliasing.

    type: ΔARCH
    description: >
      BWB winglets use neutral structural member primitives instead of geometry-specific
      rib/stringer naming. Members are classified as member_spanwise (rib alias) and
      member_chordwise (stringer alias) with region: outboard enabling geometry-neutral
      expression. This allows the same optimisation framework to apply regardless of the
      final winglet planform (blended, split-tip, canted).

    title: Member spacing discretised to 8-bit registers
    type: ΔREQ
    description: >
      Winglet member spacing is optimised via discrete 8-bit integer registers (0–255)
      per member bay. The encoding standard (STD_MEMBER_SPACING_8BIT_ENCODING.md) maps
      each register value to a physical spacing interval. Constraints are fatigue life
      (≥ 80,000 cycles) and aeroelastic divergence margin (≥ 15% above VD).

    title: Winglet fatigue life constraint
    type: ΔREQ
    description: >
      Each winglet member bay SHALL sustain a minimum of 80,000 flight cycles at the
      AMPEL360 BWB winglet load spectrum. Miner's Rule with CFRP B-basis γ = 2.0 applies.
      The winglet tip load spectrum differs from the main wing spectrum due to the winglet
      dihedral and twist (TBD at LC57-04).

    title: Winglet aeroelastic divergence constraint
    type: ΔREQ
    description: >
      Winglet member spacing SHALL produce a divergence speed V_div ≥ 1.15 × VD
      (CS-25.629(d)). The winglet aeroelastic divergence is evaluated by DLM eigenvalue
      analysis of the winglet bending/torsion stiffness matrix parameterised by member
      spacing registers. The outboard boundary condition uses the blend zone stiffness
      from BLEND_ZONE/ sub-area as the inboard constraint.

    title: Member spacing optimisation determinism requirement
    type: ΔREQ
    description: >
      The winglet member spacing optimiser SHALL be deterministic and reproducible:
      identical inputs (bay definitions, load spectrum, constraint bounds, solver config)
      SHALL produce identical member spacing register maps. SHA-256 hash per run recorded.
