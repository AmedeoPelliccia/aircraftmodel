  This index is the Single Source of Truth (SSOT) for all BLEND_ZONE deviations
  from the ATA 57 SHARED baseline. No SHARED content shall be duplicated.
  The blend zone is a transition structural field; "rib/frame" primitives do not apply.
  All structural variables are expressed as Topological Design Field (TDF) registers.

    title: Blend zone treated as Topological Design Field (TDF)
    type: ΔARCH
    description: >
      The BWB blend zone — the transition region between the centre body and the
      outboard wing — is not decomposed into ribs and frames. Instead, it is modelled
      as a continuous Topological Design Field (TDF) discretised into a patch grid.
      Each patch carries an 8-bit material/thickness register. This is fundamentally
      different from WTW rib spacing optimisation and the SHARED baseline (which is
      neutral). The TDF approach is mandated by the load-path complexity in the blend zone.

    title: TDF 8-bit register encoding standard
    type: ΔREQ
    description: >
      Each TDF patch register is encoded as an 8-bit integer (0–255) representing
      a normalised structural density/thickness parameter. The encoding standard
      (see STD_TDF_8BIT_ENCODING.md) defines the mapping from register value to
      physical parameter, boundary conditions (fixed registers at structural
      hard-points), and version-freeze rules.

    title: TDF fatigue life constraint
    type: ΔREQ
    description: >
      The TDF optimisation is subject to a fatigue life constraint: every TDF patch
      shall sustain a minimum of 80,000 flight cycles at AMPEL360 BWB design spectrum
      loads (Miner's Rule, CFRP B-basis γ = 2.0). This overrides the SHARED ATA 57
      fatigue methodology where a fixed rib pitch defines the fatigue load spectrum.

    title: TDF aeroelastic divergence constraint
    type: ΔREQ
    description: >
      The TDF optimisation is additionally constrained by aeroelastic divergence:
      divergence speed V_div / VD ≥ 1.15 (CS-25.629(d)) evaluated via Doublet
      Lattice Method (DLM) eigenvalue analysis on the blend zone stiffness matrix.
      The blend zone stiffness is a function of the TDF register map.

    title: TDF optimisation determinism and reproducibility requirement
    type: ΔREQ
    description: >
      The TDF register map produced by the optimisation solver shall be deterministic
      and reproducible: the same input (patch grid, load spectrum, constraint bounds)
      shall produce the same register map on repeated runs. A SHA-256 hash of the
      register map is recorded per run. This is required for certification traceability.
