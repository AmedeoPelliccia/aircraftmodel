    title: TDF encoding conformance
    shall: >
      The blend zone TDF optimisation module SHALL encode all structural design variables
      as 8-bit integer registers (values 0–255) per the encoding standard defined in
      STD_TDF_8BIT_ENCODING.md. No continuous-valued design variables are permitted in
      the blend zone structural optimisation.
    rationale: >
      8-bit discretisation enables GA integer chromosome representation, ensures
      reproducibility, and maps directly to certified ply-count combinations from the
      approved material database. Continuous variables cannot be version-frozen and traced.

  - req_id: BWB-57-TDF-002
    title: No rib/frame primitive in blend zone
    shall: >
      The blend zone SHALL NOT be decomposed into discrete ribs or frames. The only
      structural primitive in the blend zone optimisation domain is the TDF patch.
      This prohibition SHALL be enforced at the FEM model level by the stress office.
    rationale: >
      The BWB blend zone carries multi-directional load paths from the centre body to
      the outboard wing. Imposing rib/frame topology creates artificial load path
      discontinuities inconsistent with the continuously varying stiffness field
      characteristic of a blended planform.

  - req_id: BWB-57-TDF-003
    title: Fatigue life constraint compliance
    shall: >
      The TDF register map SHALL satisfy the fatigue life constraint C-FATIGUE defined in
      CONSTRAINTS_FATIGUE_AND_DIVERGENCE.md: Miner damage sum D ≤ 0.5 (= 1.0 / γ, γ = 2.0)
      for a minimum of 80,000 flight cycles at the AMPEL360 BWB design spectrum.
    rationale: >
      CS-25.571(a) requires damage-tolerant structure. The factor γ = 2.0 on B-basis
      allowables provides the required scatter factor for certification.

  - req_id: BWB-57-TDF-004
    title: Aeroelastic divergence constraint compliance
    shall: >
      The TDF register map SHALL satisfy the aeroelastic divergence constraint C-DIVERGENCE
      defined in CONSTRAINTS_FATIGUE_AND_DIVERGENCE.md: V_div ≥ 1.15 × VD evaluated by
      DLM eigenvalue analysis of the blend zone stiffness matrix.
    rationale: >
      CS-25.629(d) requires demonstration of adequate divergence speed margin. The blend zone
      stiffness directly governs the BWB planform divergence characteristic and must be
      included in the aeroelastic model.

  - req_id: BWB-57-TDF-005
    title: TDF optimisation determinism and reproducibility
    shall: >
      The TDF optimisation solver SHALL be deterministic and reproducible: identical inputs
      (patch grid, load spectrum, constraint bounds, solver configuration) SHALL produce
      identical register maps on repeated runs. A SHA-256 hash of the complete register map
      SHALL be recorded per solver run and stored in the governance record.
    rationale: >
      Certification traceability (CS-25.629, CS-25.571) requires that the design variable set
      be uniquely identified. A non-deterministic optimiser cannot produce a traceable register
      map version.
