  description: >
    BWB blend zone TDF patch grid. The blend zone is divided into a 2D patch array
    spanning from the centreline (y = 0) to the outboard wing spar line.
    Spanwise (η) and chordwise (ξ) patch indices define each patch.
    Total optimisable patches: TBD (to be determined at LC57-02 preliminary design).
  coordinate_system: normalised_wing_planform
  eta_range: [0.0, 0.40]   # normalised semi-span; blend zone = 0.0 to 0.40
  xi_range: [0.05, 0.90]   # normalised chord; excludes LE/TE hard-points
  patch_count_eta: TBD      # number of spanwise patch strips
  patch_count_xi: TBD       # number of chordwise patch strips

boundary_condition_classes:
  - class: HARD_POINT_SPAR
    description: Spar carry-through attach region — register fixed at 255 (maximum thickness)
    locations: [eta=0.00..0.05, xi_spar_front, eta=0.00..0.05, xi_spar_rear]
    register_constraint: fixed_255

  - class: BOUNDARY_EDGE
    description: Patch at boundary with adjacent structural zone — register within ±32 of adjacent patch
    locations: eta_max_edge, eta_min_edge
