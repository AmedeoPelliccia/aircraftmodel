# ATA 28-30 — Emergency Discharge & Safe-State

<!-- KNU-ATA28-30-001 -->

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **C² CELL Function** | Emergency Discharge & Safe-State |
| **Legacy Title** | ATA 28-30 Dump / Jettison |
| **Safety Class** | SC1 |

## Scope

This sub-chapter covers emergency discharge, controlled venting, and
safe-state transition of prime materials under abnormal conditions.

### Key Topics

- Controlled H₂ vent overboard (thermal management of vent plume)
- Emergency reservoir depressurisation sequence
- NH₃ emergency scrubbing and neutralisation (WTW variant)
- Safe-state definition: `S_safe = (M_min, P_atm, T_ambient, G_inert)`
- Phase-transition response time requirements
- Coordination with ATA 26 fire protection (leak detection → isolation)
- Ground vs in-flight emergency discharge procedures

### Design Drivers

| Driver | Metric | Target |
|---|---|---|
| Phase-transition response | seconds to safe-state | ≤ 2.0 |
| Vent plume dispersion | hazard radius | per CS-25 SC |
| NH₃ scrubber efficiency | removal fraction | ≥ 0.99 |
