# ATA 28-20 — PM Conditioning & Distribution

<!-- KNU-ATA28-20-001 -->

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **C² CELL Function** | Prime Material Conditioning & Distribution |
| **Legacy Title** | ATA 28-20 Distribution |
| **Safety Class** | SC1 |

## Scope

This sub-chapter covers the conditioning, transfer, and flow-control of
prime materials from reservoir to conversion-stack inlet manifold.

### Key Topics

- Cryogenic pump architecture (centrifugal / positive-displacement)
- Heat exchangers and vaporiser stages
- Tri-species flow control logic (LH₂ / NH₃ / LN₂ — WTW variant)
- Manifold topology and shut-off valve arrangement
- Pressure regulation and flow metering
- Recirculation return path from ATA 47 (closed-loop mode)
- Purge and inerting sequences (interface with ATA 47 N₂ system)

### Design Drivers

| Driver | Metric | Target |
|---|---|---|
| Flow stability | pressure ripple | ≤ 2 % |
| Response time | valve actuation | ≤ 0.5 s |
| Leak-before-break | probability | ≥ 0.999 |
