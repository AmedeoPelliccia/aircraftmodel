    - id: "PR-A-01"
      condition: "all materials pre-qualified from prior programme"
      action: "collapse SLC03 material selection into SLC02 requirements"
      rationale: >
        If all structural materials have existing qualification data from
        prior AMPEL programmes or Tier-1 supplier databases, the material
        selection trade is trivial; material requirements can be defined
        directly in SLC02 without a separate concept phase.

    - id: "PR-A-02"
      condition: "no novel joining process (conventional fastening only)"
      action: "remove joining process qualification sub-phase from SLC06"
      rationale: >
        Novel joining processes (bonded structures, novel fastener systems)
        require dedicated qualification sub-phases. Conventional fastening
        does not; SLC06 scope reduces to building block structural tests only.

    - id: "PR-A-03"
      condition: "ATA chapter is secondary structure (non-primary load path)"
      action: "collapse SLC06 to component-level tests only; remove sub-assembly test"
      rationale: >
        Secondary structural components (fairings, access panels) do not
        require sub-assembly or full-scale structural tests. SLC06 reduces
        to coupon/element/component level Building Block Approach.

    - id: "PR-A-04"
      condition: "no structural health monitoring system fitted"
      action: "remove SHM data collection scope from SLC10"
      rationale: >
        If no SHM instrumentation is fitted (conventional inspection-based
        maintenance), the SHM data collection activities in SLC10 are removed.
        ALI compliance tracking and FUM remain.
