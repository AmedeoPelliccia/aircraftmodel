      condition: "equipment is exact repeat from prior AMPEL programme (same part number, same DO-160 category)"
      action: "collapse SLC05 analysis and SLC06 qualification to existing EQR import"
      rationale: >
        If an SFE item is an unchanged carryover from a prior programme with
        identical DO-160 environmental categories, existing qualification data
        is imported directly. No additional analysis or qualification testing
        required; AMPEL360 performs a configuration confirmation only.

    - id: "PR-D-02"
      condition: "ATA chapter has no safety-significant function (DO-178C not applicable)"
      action: "remove DAL-based FMEA sub-phase from SLC05; use simplified hazard identification"
      rationale: >
        Cabin convenience equipment and non-safety SFE items do not require
        a DO-178C/DO-254 compliant FMEA. A simplified hazard identification
        and risk assessment is substituted.

    - id: "PR-D-03"
      condition: "single-source supplier with no competition (sole source)"
      action: "add supplier risk mitigation sub-phase to SLC03 (dual-qualification plan)"
      rationale: >
        Single-source SFE suppliers introduce supply chain resilience risk.
        A dual-qualification plan (second source qualification path) is added
        to SLC03 scope to document the risk and mitigation strategy.

    - id: "PR-D-04"
      condition: "standard off-the-shelf product with no interface modifications"
      action: "collapse SLC04 installation design to interface check only; remove bespoke design activities"
      rationale: >
        Standard catalogue products with no AMPEL360-specific modifications
        require only interface check against the standard mounting, connector,
        and fluid interface definitions. Detailed installation design is reduced
        to a compatibility confirmation.
