      rationale: >
        If the OEM engine core already holds a valid Engine Type Certificate,
        the architecture selection trade and engine-core qualification tests
        are replaced by an ETC import and interface compliance demonstration.
        The co-development qualification scope reduces to nacelle/airframe
        integration only.

      rationale: >
        If the AMPEL360 variant uses conventional kerosene (non-H2 integration),
        the H2 combustion-specific qualification activities are removed.
        This is applicable to variants where Family C is not present.

      action: "remove thrust reverser sub-phases from SLC05, SLC06, SLC07"
      rationale: >
        If the aircraft configuration does not include thrust reversers,
        all reverser-specific analysis, qualification, and integration
        activities are removed.

      condition: "nacelle is OEM-supplied complete assembly"
      action: "collapse SLC04 nacelle design into interface definition only"
      rationale: >
        If the nacelle is a complete OEM-supplied assembly (not designed
        by AMPEL360), the nacelle detailed design is replaced by interface
        definition (pylon attach, service connections). SLC04 scope reduces
