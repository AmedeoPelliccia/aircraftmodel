      condition: "ATA chapter function is DAL C or lower (no autopilot/FMS interface)"
      action: "reduce DO-178C objectives to DAL C; remove MC/DC structural coverage requirement"
      rationale: >
        DAL C software has fewer DO-178C objectives than DAL A/B. The MC/DC
        structural coverage requirement is removed; decision coverage is
        sufficient. This substantially reduces verification scope for
        non-safety-critical avionics software functions.

    - id: "PR-E-02"
      condition: "COTS hardware with existing DO-254 design assurance record accepted by Authority"
      action: "collapse SLC05 hardware analysis and SLC06 DO-254 qualification to COTS acceptance review"
      rationale: >
        COTS hardware with an existing DO-254 Design Assurance Record that
        has been accepted by the Authority for the applicable DAL can be
        accepted without re-executing hardware design assurance activities.
        SLC05 and SLC06 hardware scope reduces to a compatibility review only.

    - id: "PR-E-03"
      condition: "no novel software function (all functions carryover from prior approved version)"
      action: "apply DO-178C change impact analysis; scope verification only to changed software"
      rationale: >
        Changed software (modification to previously certified software)
        allows verification scope to be bounded by the change impact analysis.
        Only changed software components and their affected interfaces require
        full re-verification. This is the standard DO-178C modification path.

    - id: "PR-E-04"
      condition: "no iron bird required (supplier provides SIL rig equivalent)"
      action: "replace iron bird sub-phases with SIL rig equivalents in SLC06 and SLC07"
      rationale: >
        If the avionics supplier provides a Systems Integration Laboratory
        (SIL) rig with equivalent fidelity to an iron bird, the separate
        iron bird programme is replaced by the SIL rig equivalence
        demonstration, reducing capital investment and schedule risk.
