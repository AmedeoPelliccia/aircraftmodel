      condition: "single airline customer (no variability in BFE catalogue)"
      action: "collapse SLC03 catalogue definition to single-configuration design; remove variability management"
      rationale: >
        For a single launch customer with fixed BFE selections, the
        catalogue variability management and envelope-based design approach
        collapse to a single configuration. SLC03 reduces to confirming
        the specific BFE selection against structural and systems interfaces.

    - id: "PR-F-02"
      condition: "no IFE system fitted (BFE exclusion by airline)"
      action: "remove IFE-related scope from SLC02, SLC04, SLC05, SLC07, SLC10"
      rationale: >
        If the airline configuration excludes In-Flight Entertainment,
        all IFE-related requirements, design, analysis, installation, and
        monitoring activities are removed from all phases.

    - id: "PR-F-03"
      condition: "no evacuation slide fitted (overwater routes only, no slide requirement)"
      action: "remove evacuation slide sub-phases from SLC06, SLC07, SLC08, SLC11"
      rationale: >
        Certain route-specific configurations may not require evacuation
        slides (e.g., for short overwater operations with approved life
        raft substitution). This removes the slide-specific qualification,
        installation, and maintenance activities.

    - id: "PR-F-04"
      condition: "BFE item has existing STC approval on identical aircraft type"
      action: "collapse SLC05/SLC06 qualification of that BFE item to STC import review"
      rationale: >
        BFE items already approved under an STC on the same aircraft type
        do not require re-qualification. SLC05 analysis and SLC06 testing
        for that item are replaced by an STC import review and configuration
        confirmation check.
