# SSOT — Single Source of Truth

Authoritative engineering evidence for the AMPEL360 COMMON programme.

## Rules

- **No binaries** (.pdf, .html, .docx, .xlsx) — use `PUB/EXPORT/` instead
- Every artifact in LC02–LC12 longer than 5 lines must reference a **KNU ID**
- Content is structured by lifecycle phase (LC01–LC12)

## Lifecycle Directories

| Directory | Phase | Content |
|---|---|---|
| `LC01_PROBLEM_STATEMENT/` | LC01 | KNOTs, KNUs, RACI, timeline, tokenomics |
| `LC04_TRADE_STUDIES/` | LC04 | Assestment studies, IBD declarations |
| `LC05_ANALYSIS_MODELS/` | LC05 | Thermodynamic models, simulations |
