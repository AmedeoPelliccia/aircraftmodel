# --- Pacemaker Identification ---
pacemaker:
  family_code: "C"
  family_name: "Novel Technology (H2/Cryo)"
  rationale: >
    Family C (ATA-28, H2 Cryo system) has the longest transition zone
    (~18 months) due to novel technology, special conditions approval
    requirements, and immature supply chain (TRL 3-5). All other families
    must align their transition zone exit to Family C's readiness.
  transition_zone_duration_months: 18
