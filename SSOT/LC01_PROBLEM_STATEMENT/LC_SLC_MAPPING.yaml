mappings:

  - lc_phase: "LC01"
    lc_name: "Problem Statement"
    repository_directory: "LC01_PROBLEM_STATEMENT/"
    slc_phases: ["SLC01"]
    slc_names: ["Uncertainty Register"]
    zone: "Compress"
    relationship: >
      Aircraft LC01 instantiates system-level KNOT registers. Programme-level
      KNOTs and KNUs are seeded here; each system family initialises its
      SLC01 Uncertainty Register from these aircraft-level artefacts.

  - lc_phase: "LC02"
    lc_name: "Requirements"
    repository_directory: "LC02_REQUIREMENTS/"
    slc_phases: ["SLC02"]
    slc_names: ["Technology Requirements"]
    zone: "Compress"
    relationship: >
      Aircraft requirements decompose into system SLC02 per family.
      Performance, safety, and interface requirements flow down from the
      aircraft level to each system family's technology requirements baseline.

  - lc_phase: "LC03"
    lc_name: "Preliminary Design"
    repository_directory: "LC03_PRELIMINARY_DESIGN/"
    slc_phases: ["SLC03", "SLC04"]
    slc_names: ["Concept/Material Selection", "Design Definition"]
    zone: "Compress"
    relationship: >
      System families execute SLC03+SLC04 concurrently within LC03.
      Concept and material selection (SLC03) run in parallel with initial
      design definition (SLC04) to compress the development schedule.

  - lc_phase: "LC04"
    lc_name: "Design Review"
    repository_directory: "LC04_DESIGN_REVIEW/"
    slc_phases: ["SLC04", "SLC05"]
    slc_names: ["Design Definition (gate)", "Analysis"]
    zone: "Compress"
    relationship: >
      Aircraft design review gates aggregate system SLC04/SLC05 outputs.
      Design definition is gated at this phase; analysis models feed
      qualification evidence into the design review package.

  - lc_phase: "LC05"
    lc_name: "Analysis Models"
    repository_directory: "LC05_ANALYSIS_MODELS/"
    slc_phases: ["SLC05"]
    slc_names: ["Analysis"]
    zone: "Compress→Transition"
    relationship: >
      System analysis models feed qualification evidence. This phase bridges
      the compress and transition zones; analysis artefacts produced here
      become the foundation for qualification campaigns.

  - lc_phase: "LC06"
    lc_name: "Testing and PMU"
    repository_directory: "LC06_TESTING_PMU/"
    slc_phases: ["SLC06", "SLC07"]
    slc_names: ["Qualification", "System Integration"]
    zone: "Transition"
    relationship: >
      System qualification (SLC06) and integration testing (SLC07) executed
      at aircraft level. Ground integration test campaigns and PMU validation
      occur here. Family C (H2) is the pacemaker for this phase.

  - lc_phase: "LC07"
    lc_name: "Industrial Process Qualification"
    repository_directory: "LC07_INDUSTRIAL_PROCESS_QUALIFICATION/"
    slc_phases: ["SLC07"]
    slc_names: ["Integration (manufacturing)"]
    zone: "Transition"
    relationship: >
      Production process qualification. Manufacturing integration of all
      system families is validated; production readiness reviews are gated
      here before industrial ramp-up.

  - lc_phase: "LC08"
    lc_name: "Flight Test and Certification"
    repository_directory: "LC08_FLIGHT_TEST_CERTIFICATION/"
    slc_phases: ["SLC08"]
    slc_names: ["Certification"]
    zone: "Transition"
    relationship: >
      Aircraft-level certification aggregates system SLC08 outputs.
      Type Certificate is the gate exit. All system family certification
      evidence must be consolidated before TC application.

  - lc_phase: "LC09"
    lc_name: "Industrial Plan"
    repository_directory: "LC09_INDUSTRIAL_PLAN/"
    slc_phases: ["SLC09"]
    slc_names: ["Infrastructure"]
    zone: "Transition"
    relationship: >
      Production ramp-up. Supply chain infrastructure and production
      planning for all system families is executed concurrently with
      flight test (SLC08/LC08).

  - lc_phase: "LC10"
    lc_name: "Fleet Operations"
    repository_directory: "LC10_FLEET_OPERATIONS/"
    slc_phases: ["SLC10"]
    slc_names: ["Operations"]
    zone: "Extend"
    relationship: >
      In-service operations, monitoring, and fleet data collection.
      Condition-based maintenance data feeds back to the digital twin
      and LC_MEMORIES for next-programme learning.

  - lc_phase: "LC11"
    lc_name: "MRO Plan"
    repository_directory: "LC11_MRO_PLAN/"
    slc_phases: ["SLC11"]
    slc_names: ["Reconditioning"]
    zone: "Extend"
    relationship: >
      MRO execution per system family. Heavy maintenance visits coordinate
      reconditioning scope across families to minimise aircraft downtime.

  - lc_phase: "LC12"
    lc_name: "Reconditioning"
    repository_directory: "LC12_RECONDITIONING/"
    slc_phases: ["SLC11", "SLC12"]
    slc_names: ["Reconditioning", "Reconditioning Loop"]
    zone: "Extend"
    relationship: >
      System reconditioning cycles. Modular components are reconditioned,
      re-certified, and returned to service. Digital Product Passport (DPP)
      circularity data is updated at each cycle.
