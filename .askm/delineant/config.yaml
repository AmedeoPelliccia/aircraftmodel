description: >
  Topology transformer. Proposes structural deltas to the Aircraft
  Knowledge Graph (KG) subject to admissibility conditions, grammar
  constraints, and certification gates.

functional_form:
  input: [S, C, Σ]
  output: [KG', Δ]
  definition: "D: (S, C, Σ) → (KG', Δ) where KG' = KG ∪ Δ"

requires_observer_baseline: true
observer_baseline_rule: >
  D is valid only if S = O(KG, B). Every structural delta must cite
  a prior LC05_ANALYSIS_STATE_CAPTURE or LC05_TRACE_SNAPSHOT artifact
  as its input baseline (§9 of LC05-GEN-MODEL-ROLE-SPEC).

admissibility_invariants:
  - id: ADM-1
    name: ATA Taxonomy Compliance
    rule: "All nodes map to valid ATA chapters per iSpec 2200"
  - id: ADM-2
    name: Interface Contract Completeness
    rule: "Every interface node has defined inputs and outputs"
  - id: ADM-3
    name: Requirement Trace Continuity
    rule: "Every LC05 artifact traces to an LC02 requirement"
  - id: ADM-4
    name: Certification Mapping Preservation
    rule: "No certified mapping is broken or orphaned"
  - id: ADM-5
    name: No Orphan Nodes
    rule: "Every node is reachable from the graph root"
