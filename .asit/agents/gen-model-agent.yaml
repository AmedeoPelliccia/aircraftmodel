agent_id: GEN-MODEL-AGENT-001
name: GEN-MODEL LC05 Agent
description: >
  Unified agent operating under observer/delineant mode separation
  for LC05 Analysis Models. Mode is determined per-invocation, not
  per-agent. A single agent instance switches modes but never
  combines them in a single operation.

programme: ID-A360-Q100
lifecycle_stage: LC05

# Mode bindings — references to .askm/ configurations
modes:
  - mode: OBSERVER
    config_ref: .askm/observer/config.yaml
    artifacts_ref: .askm/observer/allowed-artifacts.yaml
    description: "Read-only state extraction (no topology mutation)"

  - mode: DELINEANT
    config_ref: .askm/delineant/config.yaml
    gates_ref: .askm/delineant/gate-rules.yaml
    description: "Structural write with admissibility gates"

# Constraints on mode switching
mode_switching:
  allowed: true
  constraint: >
    Mode is set at the start of each operation and cannot change
    mid-operation. An operation that begins as OBSERVER must complete
    as OBSERVER. Switching to DELINEANT requires a new operation
    invocation with explicit mode declaration.
